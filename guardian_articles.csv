In response, Nato scrambled two Typhoon Eurofighters from its air patrol mission in the Baltic. The Russian planes went 700 metres into Lithuanian airspace before leaving after 18 seconds, probably during aerial refuelling training, said the Lithuanian military. The foreign ministry in Vilnius said it had summoned the charge d’affaires from the Russian embassy and issued a “strong protest”. Russia’s defence ministry denied the incursion had taken place. In September, three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets lingered for 12 minutes in Estonian airspace, prompting protests at the UN security council and a warning from the Nato council. Two Ukrainian journalists were killed by a high-powered Russian drone in the eastern city of Kramatorsk on Thursday in an attack described by Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman as a war crime. Olena Hubanova and Yevhen Karmazin from Ukraine’s state-funded Freedom television channel, were hit by a Lancet drone while in their car at a petrol station, said Vadym Filashkin, the Donetsk region governor. Freedom, which broadcasts in Russian, also confirmed their deaths. The general prosecutor’s office said a colleague of the two journalists had also been wounded and that it had opened a war crime investigation. It posted a photo of a destroyed red car and an image of two flak jackets marked “press” in the boot. Lancets are usually reserved for attacks on tanks and armoured vehicles. Last week, a correspondent for Russia’s RIA news agency was killed and another wounded in Zaporizhzhia in what RIA said was a Ukrainian drone strike. Dan Sabbagh and Artem Mazhulin write that an attempt by Russia to connect the illegally occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Russian grid in time for Vladimir Putin’s birthday was foiled by Ukrainian forces operating behind enemy lines. Ukrainian partisans attacked substations in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region, damaging a new high-voltage connection from the plant to the Russian grid, according to sources. This forced Russian engineers to restore the original power line from Ukraine to power the cooling systems and prevent a radioactive meltdown. The cooling systems had been running on last-resort diesel backup generators after, according to Ukraine and independent experts, Russia deliberately damaged the Ukrainian line to try to justify transfer to the Russian grid. The International Atomic Energy Agency stepped in to insist that external power be restored immediately. Ukraine’s forces struck Russia’s Ryazan oil refinery, the general staff of the Ukrainian military said. The attack caused a fire at the plant critical for Russian military supplies, the general staff said, adding that Ukrainian drones also hit an ammunition depot in Belgorod region. The reports could not be independently verified. Keir Starmer will urge European leaders to boost long-range missile supplies to Kyiv at a London summit on Friday of the “coalition of the willing” that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is set to attend. Starmer will announce the acceleration of air defence missile manufacturing with the aim of supplying Ukraine with more than 5,000 of them. About 140 “lightweight-multirole missiles” will be delivered to Ukraine this winter. The UK and France already supply Ukraine with Storm Shadow and Scalp long-range missiles, and Ukraine produces its own Flamingo and Neptune cruise missiles. Zelenskyy, urged EU leaders to agree as soon as possible on a plan to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. A hoped-for decision was postponed on Thursday and the language around the proposal watered down after opposition from Belgium, which hosts most of the Russian central bank funds immobilised in the EU at the Brussels-based institution Euroclear. Belgium’s prime minister, Bart De Wever, said: “We want guarantees if the money has to be paid back that every member state will chip in. The consequences cannot only be for Belgium.” EU leaders agreed at their summit in Brussels on Thursday to merely to ask the European Commission to present “options for financial support” for Ukraine, without direct reference to Russian frozen assets. Jennifer Rankin writes that Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, insisted there had been an agreement on the principle. “We agreed on the what – that is the reparation loan – and we have to work on the how – how we make it possible.” Zelenskyy told EU leaders that “anyone who delays this decision is not only limiting our defence but also slowing down your own progress”, promising that Ukraine would spend a lot of money buying European weapons. “The time to act on Russian assets is now and I urge for your full support.” Finland will buy US weapons for Ukraine for €100m (£86m), the Finnish daily Helsingin Sanomat (HS) reported on Thursday, citing the prime minister, Petteri Orpo. Moscow handed over the bodies of 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers and received 31 bodies of its own fallen soldiers in return, authorities on both sides reported on Thursday."
world/2025/oct/22/ukraine-war-briefing-storm-shadow-missiles-hit-gunpowder-plant-in-russia,Ukraine war briefing: Storm Shadow missiles ‘hit gunpowder plant in Russia’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/ukraine-war-briefing-storm-shadow-missiles-hit-gunpowder-plant-in-russia,Ukraine war briefing: Storm Shadow missiles ‘hit gunpowder plant in Russia’,"Storm Shadow missiles struck a Russian chemical plant making gunpowder, explosives and rocket fuel in the Bryansk region, Ukraine’s military said late on Tuesday. The French-British missiles are also known as Scalp. “A massive combined missile and airstrike was carried out, including with air-launched Storm Shadow missiles that penetrated Russia’s air defence system,” said Ukraine’s armed forces general staff. Alexander Bogomaz, the governor of Bryansk region, said on Tuesday afternoon that Ukraine attacked the region with drones and missiles. The Russian defence ministry also confirmed an attack. Russian strikes on Kyiv killed at least two people, the head of the city’s military administration, Tymur Tkachenko, said on Wednesday. The attacks sparked fires and shattered windows in several districts, mayor Vitali Klitschko said. Other city officials reported a large drone attack followed the strikes. Other areas being hit included Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, and the city of Izmail, a port on the Danube river. Plans for a summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Budapest have been shelved, Dan Sabbagh reports, after an apparently unproductive phone call between Marco Rubio and Sergei Lavrov. Their call also led to the cancellation of a meeting planned in Hungary’s capital for this Thursday between Rubio, Donald Trump’s secretary of state, and Lavrov, Vladimir Putin’s foreign minister. A senior European diplomat told Reuters the Russians “haven’t at all changed” their maximalist position of Ukraine giving up the entire Donbas region. “And I assume Lavrov gave the same spiel, and Rubio was like: ‘See you later’.” Another European diplomat thought that “it became evident for the Americans that there will be no deal for Trump in Budapest”. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia “almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy” once US Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine were no longer an immediate prospect. The Ukrainian president continued: “The greater the Ukrainian long-range capability, the greater the Russian willingness to end the war … As soon as the issue of long-range [capability] became a little further away for us – for Ukraine – Russia almost automatically became less interested in diplomacy.” The diplomatic efforts centred around Trump were “going in circles” and felt as if they were being dragged out, a senior Ukrainian official told Agence France-Presse. While varying from day to day, Trump’s most recent stance is that the war should be halted along the current frontline without Ukraine making territorial concessions. European diplomats meanwhile said countries were working with Ukraine on a new proposal for a ceasefire along current battle lines. One told Reuters the proposal included a reference to a peace board that would be chaired by Trump, while another said it would be modelled on the US 20-point plan on Gaza. Some 35 allies of Ukraine will meet on Friday in London for a summit among countries willing to provide long-term support to Kyiv. The European work on a peace proposal seems at least partly calculated to simply keep Washington engaged with helping Ukraine by giving Trump and the US an important role, rather than produce a deal both sides would actually accept. For example, a proposal to siphon off some of Russia’s frozen assets to fund a portion of reparations payments to Ukraine “would be a non-starter for Russia”, one diplomat said. Russian attacks killed four people and left hundreds of thousands without power and many without water in Ukraine’s Chernihiv region on Tuesday. The energy ministry said the regional capital, Chernihiv city, and the northern part of the province lost all electricity supply after strikes on power facilities. By the afternoon, Reuters reporters in Chernihiv saw that power supply was back in some places. A daytime attack by about 20 Russian kamikaze drones killed four civilians and wounded at least seven more including a 10-year-old child in the town of Novhorod-Siverskyi, local officials said."
world/2025/oct/25/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-urges-us-to-expand-russia-oil-sanctions,Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy urges US to expand Russia oil sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/25/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-urges-us-to-expand-russia-oil-sanctions,Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy urges US to expand Russia oil sanctions,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the US to expand sanctions on Russian oil from two companies to the whole sector, and appealed for long-range missiles to hit back at Russia. Zelenskyy was in London for talks with two dozen European leaders. The Ukrainian leader said Trump’s decision this week to impose oil sanctions was “a big step,” and said “we have to apply pressure not only to Rosneft and Lukoil, but to all Russian oil companies”. The Ukrainian leader chose not to overtly lobby for the supply of US Tomahawk cruise missiles at the meeting but instead emphasised the need for the west to work together. British prime minister Keir Starmer, however, said there was more that they could do to bolster Kyiv’s long-range missile capability. “I think there’s further we can do on capability, particularly … long-range capability and, of course, the vital work for coalition of the willing when it comes to the security guarantees that are necessary,” Starmer said. Zelenskyy’s call for missiles came as Russia again attacked Ukraine with missiles and drones on Saturday. In Dnipropetrovsk, the regional military administration chief said two people were killed and seven more wounded in missile and drone attacks. Moscow also targeted the capital Kyiv, damaging buildings and homes in multiple districts and wounding at least eight people. Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said he discussed the issue of sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine with US president Donald Trump and it is still under review. “On particularly, the Tomahawks, of course, the president and I discussed that. The issue remains under review by the president and again, it’s up to the US to decide,” said Rutte. The European allies also said frozen Russian assets needed to be used quickly, with Starmer saying there was “absolute clarity” during the meeting that progress on using the frozen assets to fund a loan to support Ukraine must be realised. EU leaders on Thursday stopped short of endorsing a plan to use frozen Russian assets to fund a giant loan to Kyiv, over concerns raised by Belgium, where hundreds of billions of dollars in Russian reserves are held. Moscow has promised a “painful response” if the assets are seized. Russia’s top economic negotiator arrived in the United States for talks, two days after Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow’s two biggest oil companies. “Arrived in the US to continue the US-Russia dialogue – visit planned a while ago based on an invitation from the US side,” Kirill Dmitriev said on X. Earlier this week Trump scrapped planned talks with Putin in Budapest, saying he did not want a “wasted” meeting. In an interview with CNN, Dmitriev said that a meeting between Donald Trump and Putin will happen but “probably at a later date”. Dmitriev said in the same interview with CNN that he believes his country, the United States and Ukraine are close to a diplomatic solution to end the war. He did not offer details of what this would entail. European nations are working with Ukraine on a new proposal for a ceasefire in the war along current battle lines, according to Reuters. “It’s a big move by President Zelenskyy to already acknowledge that it’s about battle lines,” Dmitriev said. “You know, his previous position was that Russia should leave completely – so actually, I think we are reasonably close to a diplomatic solution that can be worked out.” Dmitriev also said he did not believe that the recently imposed US sanctions on Russian oil companies will have a significant impact on the Russian economy because “oil prices in the world will rise and Russia will sell just fewer gallons of oil, but at the higher price.” The swiftness of the sanctions appeared to catch Moscow off guard, Pjotr Sauer wrote, adding that Putin conceded the sanctions could cost Russia’s economy, telling reporters on Thursday that “some losses are expected”. At the heart of Trump’s current misalignment with Moscow is his demand for an immediate ceasefire that would serve as the basis for peace talks. Trump has also urged both sides to freeze the current frontlines – a proposal supported by Ukraine and its European allies. Putin, however, has firmly ruled out halting the fighting until a comprehensive agreement is reached that addresses what the Kremlin calls the “root causes” of the conflict."

Sybiha said drone attacks on the weekend were not accidental but well-planned strikes. “Russia is deliberately endangering nuclear safety in Europe,” he said. Russia launched a barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine over the weekend, killing at least seven people and damaging energy infrastructure in three regions, according to Ukrainian officials. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Russia had launched more than 450 drones and 45 missiles, most of which were shot down. Three people were killed and 12 wounded when a drone hit an apartment building in Dnipro, and another person was killed in the Kharkiv region. Three were killed in the south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region, regional officials said. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday work was under way on President Vladimir Putin’s order to prepare proposals for a possible Russian nuclear test, state news agency TASS reported. The order was in response to President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement last month that the US would resume testing. Russia-US relations have deteriorated sharply in the past few weeks because of Trump’s frustration about the lack of progress towards ending the war in Ukraine. A second external power line to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been restored, the station’s Russian operators were quoted as saying on Saturday. The plant – Europe’s largest, with six reactors – was seized by Russian troops in the first weeks of the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. It currently produces no electricity, but needs external power to cool the nuclear fuel and avoid the risk of a meltdown. Millions of tonnes of Russian oil have been traded through a port in Singapore part-owned by Australia’s Macquarie Bank and potentially sold to Australian businesses, new data shows. The identification of a new link between Australia and the trade in Russian-origin products exposes further gaps in government sanctions, as Australia lags Europe and UK in tightening import rules. Australia stopped buying fuel directly from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine but has imported more than 3m tonnes of Russian-originating oil products since 2023, the Europe-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea) has found. Hungary said on Saturday it had obtained an indefinite waiver from US sanctions to use Russian oil and gas, but a White House official reaffirmed the exemption was for one year only. Last month, US President Donald Trump imposed Ukraine-related sanctions on Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft that carried a threat of further sanctions against entities that buy oil from those firms. Hungary, which relies heavily on Russian energy, asked for a reprieve from the sanctions. Old fishing nets from France are becoming a vital protection against Russian drones attacking Ukraine. In fishing ports along the coast of Brittany, discarded horsehair fishing nets, previously a waste problem, are being used to catch Russian drones. Russia employs small cheap drones and fits them with explosives, directing them by remote control for distances of up to 25km. The Ukrainians use the nets to create tunnels in which drone propellers become entangled."

Because of this, emergency power outages have been introduced in a number of regions of Ukraine,” Svitlana Grynchuk posted. “Emergency power outages will be cancelled after the situation in the energy system stabilises.” Drones hit energy infrastructure in the Odesa region of Ukraine’s south late on Friday evening, said the regional governor, Oleg Kiper. “There was damage to an energy infrastructure facility,” he said, reporting no dead or wounded. Ukraine’s Naftogaz said it would import at least 300m cubic metres of US liquid natural gas through an agreement with Poland’s Orlen, a gas trader and pipeline operator, to help stabilise the heating season ahead. “Despite the enemy’s plans, Ukraine will have light and heat this winter,” said Grynchuk, the energy minister. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday that Russia was massing troops near the city of Vovchansk in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region. Speaking to reporters in Kyiv, Ukraine’s president said Moscow’s assault on the eastern city of Pokrovsk was aimed at demonstrating battlefield success to Donald Trump, the US president. The Institute for the Study of War said Russian troops had advanced marginally near the mostly destroyed, partly Russian-held city in pursuit of bringing Kharkiv city within range of tube artillery. Ukrainian army units reported that Russian troops filmed themselves raising a flag in Vovchansk, only to be quickly killed by Ukrainian drones. The Kremlin was forced to deny strong rumours that the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has fallen out of favour with Vladimir Putin. Lavrov, 75, was absent from a big Kremlin meeting this week that he would typically attend, and Putin chose someone else to attend a G20 summit in South Africa later this month, a role that Lavrov has filled in the past. For two weeks in a row the foreign ministry has also not disclosed Lavrov’s travel plans and speaking engagements for the following week. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there was “nothing true” in reports that Lavrov was in trouble. The US has granted Hungary a one-year exemption from sanctions targeting Russian oil and gas, according to a White House official. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, visited Trump on Friday. The White House official noted that Hungary had committed to buying US liquefied natural gas with contracts worth about $600m. Most Russian nationals will now have to apply for a new visa each time they travel to the EU after it cancelled their right to apply for multiple-entry visas. The European Commission said this would allow for “close and frequent scrutiny of applicants to mitigate any potential security risk”. Numerous acts of sabotage in European countries have been traced to Russian operatives. Exceptions would be made for people “whose reliability and integrity is without doubt” like dissidents, independent journalists or human rights defenders, and for close family members of Russians living in the EU, or family members of EU citizens living in Russia, the commission said. The sanctioned Russian tank and railcar manufacturer Uralvagonzavod (UVZ) was planning job cuts of up to 10%, local media reported, as the company confirmed a restructure to reduce costs. UVZ has publicly said it produces T-90M battle tanks and modernises T-72B3M tanks. Some staff were moved to a four-day week last month as the company grapples with a decline in demand for freight railcars due to a steep fall in Russian exports. Russia’s biggest industrial companies, including automakers and mining and metallurgical companies, are putting employees on furlough or sacking them as the war economy slows, domestic demand stalls, and exports dry up, sources and companies have told Reuters. More than 1,400 citizens from three dozen African countries are fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, Kyiv’s foreign minister said on Friday. Andriy Sybiha said Russia was enticing Africans to sign contracts that he described as “equivalent to … a death sentence … Most of them are immediately sent to the so-called ‘meat assaults’, where they are quickly killed.” South Africa said on Thursday it would investigate how 17 of its citizens joined mercenary forces after the men sent distress calls for help to return home. Kenya has said some of its citizens were detained in military camps across Russia after unknowingly getting caught up in the war. Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday appointed a new commander for drone air defences and tasked him with their improvement. The president’s office said Yuri Cherevashenko had experience in helping create Ukraine’s first group of reaction forces of air defence mobile brigades and he played a role in developing interceptor drones. Ukraine’s top commander, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in September that Ukraine was looking to improve performance by interceptor drones to create a “layered system” of defence."

Trump “doesn’t feel like they’re putting enough on the table to end the war”, Vance said in North Carolina. “If the Russians refuse to negotiate in good faith, I think it’s going to be very, very bad for their country. That’s what the president made clear.” In a meeting earlier on Wednesday in New York, US secretary of state Marco Rubio apparently clashed with his Russian counterpart, calling for the “killing to stop” and demanding Moscow “take meaningful steps toward a durable resolution”. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov fired back and “stressed the unacceptability of the schemes promoted by Kyiv and some European capitals aimed at prolonging the conflict”, according to a readout of their conversation supplied by the Russian side. Trump unexpectedly suggested at the UN on Tuesday after meeting Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Ukraine could not only retake all of the territory it lost to Russia militarily since the 2022 Russian invasion but take even more. The Ukrainian president praised Trump following the surprise pivot but cautioned that Nato alone could not underwrite his country’s security. “Because international institutions are too weak, this madness continues,” Zelenskyy told the general assembly. “Even being part of the longstanding military alliance doesn’t automatically mean you are safe.” He said he had a “good meeting” with Trump. “Of course we are doing everything to make sure Europe truly helps and of course we count on the United States.” Zelenskyy appealed to global leaders to intervene to prevent Russia from leading the world through “the most destructive arms race in human history”, warning that the combination of drone technology and artificial intelligence would end in catastrophe, report Patrick Wintour, Oliver Holmes, Pjotr Sauer and Jennifer Rankin. Speaking to the UN general assembly on Wednesday, the Ukrainian president tried to galvanise not just the west but also China. His chilling account of how Russia is using technology to change the face of war was the opposite of Trump’s claim that Russia’s military may only be a paper tiger. Zelenskyy warned that Russian president Vladimir Putin, if unchecked, would use drones to expand his war throughout Europe. “Stopping Russia now is cheaper than wondering who will be the first to create a simple drone carrying a nuclear warhead,” he said. Russia said it would press on with its military offensive in Ukraine and rejected Trump’s claim that Kyiv’s army could retake territory seized by Russia. The Kremlin also pushed back at Trump’s characterisation of Russia as a “paper tiger”. “The idea that Ukraine can recapture something is, from our point of view, mistaken,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He bristled at the accusation Russia was weak, saying it was a “real bear”, while conceding Russia’s economy was “experiencing tensions and problems”. Ukraine and Syria formally restored diplomatic relations as their leaders met on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, Zelenskyy said. Ukraine broke off relations with Syria in 2022 after ousted Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad’s government recognised the independence of swathes of occupied Ukraine following Russia’s full-scale invasion. Ukraine has worked to engage with Syrian authorities since the December 2024 toppling of Assad, a staunch Russian ally. “We are pleased with this important step and are ready to support the Syrian people on their path to stability,” Zelenskyy said on Wednesday, while Syria’s leadership said it hoped for close relations with Kyiv."

People in Kyiv heard blasts throughout Thursday night and many woke up without power on Friday after the huge air attack targeted Ukraine’s energy system. Images posted online showed firefighters working to tackle burning blocks of flats. Hrynchuk did not say how many people had lost power. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the Russian strikes targeted civilian and energy infrastructure as Ukraine prepares for winter temperatures. Russian drones and missiles damaged 12 apartment buildings in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, killing a seven-year-old boy and injuring four people, according to the regional governor. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said 12 people had been injured, with eight of them taken to hospital. Vladimir Putin rowed back his deputy foreign minister’s declaration that the “momentum” from the Alaska talks had been lost and that the “edifice of relations” between the US and Russia “has cracked and is collapsing … the cracks have reached the foundation”. Rybakov made the comments during the week after Donald Trump hardened his line towards Russia. Putin, Russia’s president, said on Friday: “These are complex issues that require further consideration. But we remain committed to the discussion that took place in Anchorage.” An aide to Putin said contacts with Washington were continuing. “Fair use” of frozen Russian assets for Ukraine’s defence and rebuilding was discussed between the European Central Bank president, Christine Lagarde, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday. “There are solutions for how this can be done,” said Ukraine’s president, calling for more political will in Europe to do it. “We are getting closer to a decision on the assets, and I thank everyone who is helping.” Melania Trump said on Friday that eight Ukrainian children had been reunited with their families after contact with Vladimir Putin. The US first lady in August wrote a letter to Putin and had her husband hand-deliver it during his meeting with the Russian president in Alaska. The eight children were been reunited with their families “over the past 24 hours”, the US first lady said on Friday."

The White House did not immediately respond to an email on Sunday asking what steps Trump was contemplating. Trump said on Sunday night that “certain European leaders are coming over to our country on Monday or Tuesday individually” and he would also speak to Vladimir Putin soon. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on Sunday that the US and the EU could put “secondary tariffs on the countries that buy Russian oil”, pushing the Russian economy to the brink of collapse and bringing Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. China is a major buyer of Russian energy exports. Trump has placed a 50% tariff on Indian goods – ostensibly because it imports Russian oil, although the US president harbours other grievances involving India, reportedly including its prime minister’s refusal to nominate him for a Nobel peace prize. Donald Trump gave Vladimir Putin what he wanted by hosting the Russian president in Alaska, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told the US network ABC. “And it’s a pity … Putin doesn’t want to meet with me, but he wants very much to meet with the president of the United States, to show everybody video and images that he is there.” The ABC presenter Martha Raddatz put to Zelenskyy “[Putin] said he will meet if you come to Moscow,” to which the Ukrainian president responded scornfully: “He can come to Kyiv,” adding: “I can’t go to Moscow when my country is under missiles, under attacks each day … he understands it.” Putin’s stance was a ploy to postpone their meeting, Zelenskyy said, adding that he was “ready for any kind of meeting – but not in Russia – any kind of meeting, bilateral [only with Putin], trilateral [adding Trump]”. Separately the Ukrainian president said he was counting on a strong US response to the largest ever Russian barrage on Ukraine. A mother and her baby were among the dead, and for the first time a key government building in Kyiv was hit, writes Kate Connolly. “It is important that there is a broad response from partners to this attack today,” said Zelenskyy on Sunday. “We are counting on a strong response from America. That is what is needed.” Trump’s Ukraine war envoy, Keith Kellogg, said on Sunday that the Russian attack “was not a signal that Russia wants to diplomatically end this war”. In other areas of Ukraine, a teenage girl was injured when Russian mortars hit homes in Kupyansk, Kharkiv region, officials said; and a woman was hurt in a drone strike on Sumy city, said the head of the regional administration. Ukraine’s military said it attacked the Druzhba oil pipeline in Russia’s Bryansk region, inflicting “comprehensive fire damage” during an overnight attack on Sunday. It is part of a strategy to target Russia’s energy industry, which is the backbone of its economy and helps fund the war. Recipients of oil from the pipeline include Hungary and Slovakia whose prime ministers are friendly to Vladimir Putin. Ukraine’s defence ministry said a new meeting of Kyiv’s allies was being planned and air defences and supplies for Kyiv’s deep strikes on Russia would be discussed."

This complicates the situation,” Zelenskyy said in a social media post late Saturday. “If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater – peaceful coexistence with its neighbors for decades.” Trump has said that he had agreed with Putin that a peace deal should be sought without the prior ceasefire that Ukraine and its European allies, until now with US support, have demanded. Ukrainian and European leaders fear that a straight-to-peace deal, skipping over a preliminary ceasefire, gives Moscow an upper hand in talks. After his meeting with Vladimir Putin on Friday, Donald Trump told European leaders that he supported a plan to end the Ukraine-Russia war by ceding unconquered land to Russia, the New York Times reported, citing two senior European officials. The officials said Trump will discuss the plan with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday when the Ukrainian president visits the White House, adding that European leaders have been invited to join. Trump earlier said that Kyiv should make a deal with Moscow because “Russia is a very big power, and they’re not.” European officials will decide this weekend whether Zelenskyy will be accompanied on the visit to Washington, German foreign minister Johann Wadephul said on Saturday. European leaders, including Macron, Merz and Starmer, are set to discuss the issues with Zelenskyy on Sunday via video call ahead of his meeting with Trump, the French president’s office said in a statement. A joint statement issued by European leaders said they were “ready to work with US President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy towards a trilateral summit with European support” but “it will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory. International borders must not be changed by force.” The leaders of eight Nordic-Baltic nations said on Saturday that they remain steadfast in their support for Ukraine and to the efforts by Trump to end the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden said in a statement that achieving peace between Ukraine and Russia requires a ceasefire and security guarantees for Ukraine: “We welcome President Trump’s statement that the US is prepared to participate in security guarantees. No limitations should be placed on Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation with other countries,” the statement said. At the Alaska summit, Putin demanded Ukraine withdraw from Donetsk and Luhansk as a condition for ending the war, but offered Trump a freeze along the remaining frontline, two sources with direct knowledge of the talks told the Guardian. Although Luhansk is almost entirely under Russian control, Ukraine still holds key parts of Donetsk, including the cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk and heavily fortified positions whose defence has cost tens of thousands of lives. Eight pages of US government planning documents for the summit meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin were left in a hotel printer in Anchorage before the meeting on Friday, NPR reported. The documents, which were posted online by NPR, appear to have been produced by Trump administration officials in charge of summit planning and included the precise locations and times for the scheduled meetings, as well the phone numbers of US government employees. Canadian prime minister Mark Carney welcomed what he said was US openness to providing security guarantees to Ukraine under a peace deal to end Russia’s war against Kyiv. “Robust and credible security guarantees are essential to any just and lasting peace. I welcome the openness of the United States to providing security guarantees as part of Coalition of the Willing’s efforts,” Carney said in a statement. Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from first lady Melania Trump to Russian leader Vladimir Putin raising the plight of Ukrainian and Russian children caught in the middle of the ongoing war between the two European countries, it was reported on Saturday. The contents of the letter were unknown – but two Trump administration officials told Reuters that it mentioned the abductions of children resulting from the war that broke out after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. However, the text of the letter, which was obtained and posted online by Fox News on Saturday, is extremely opaque and makes no reference at all to the abductions or transfer of children from Russian-occupied Ukraine to Russia. Vladimir Putin has said that his visit to Alaska was “useful and timely”, the Russian news agency Tass reported on Saturday. Putin also added that his conversation with Trump was “sincere and substantive”, adding that Russia respects the position of the US and also wants to settle the Ukrainian conflict peacefully. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov held calls on Saturday with his Turkish and Hungarian counterparts, the Russian foreign ministry said. The phone call between Lavrov and Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan took place at Turkey’s initiative, the Russian foreign ministry said, and exchanged views on the Russia-US meeting, without elaborating further. The Ukrainian military said it had pushed Russian forces back by about 2km (1.2 miles) on part of the Sumy front in northern Ukraine. There was no immediate comment from Russia, which controls a little over 200 sq km in the region, according to Ukraine’s battlefield mapping project DeepState."
world/2025/oct/27/ukraine-war-briefing-russian-claims-test-of-nuclear-powered-missile-known-as-flying-chornobyl,Ukraine war briefing: Russia claims test of nuclear-powered missile condemned as ‘flying Chornobyl’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/27/ukraine-war-briefing-russian-claims-test-of-nuclear-powered-missile-known-as-flying-chornobyl,Ukraine war briefing: Russia claims test of nuclear-powered missile condemned as ‘flying Chornobyl’,"Vladimir Putin claimed Russia had successfully tested its Burevestnik cruise missile – said to be both powered by a nuclear engine and capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. It has been called a “flying Chornobyl” by arms control experts because it is powered by a nuclear reactor and, depending on the design, potentially spews out radioactive exhaust as it flies. On the weekend, Russia’s top general, Valery Gerasimov, told Putin the missile travelled 14,000km (8,700 miles) and was in the air for about 15 hours when it was tested on 21 October. The Burevestnik has been dubbed the SSC-X-9 Skyfall by Nato. Russia has regularly threatened that the Ukraine war could go nuclear, for example if allies join Ukraine on the battlefield or provide it with long-range strike weapons as they have done. A major nuclear accident in August 2019 killed five Russian scientists who were suspected to have been working on the Burevestnik or something similar. The incident released radiation into surrounding areas. That November, awarding posthumous decorations to the victims’ families, Putin said they had been working on an “unparalleled” weapon. Ukrainian drones forced the closure of Moscow’s Domodedovo airport and the smaller Zhukovsky airport, Russian authorities said early on Monday. Russian defence units downed 28 drones from Sunday night into Monday morning, said the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin. There was no information about damage. Russia rarely discloses the full scale of damage inflicted by Ukrainian strikes inside its territory unless civilian objects are involved. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine. Kyiv has said that its attacks aim to destroy infrastructure key to Moscow’s war effort. US sanctions on Russia’s oil industry had an immediate effect, writes Jill Ambrose. Within hours, there was a 6% rise in the global oil price and reports were emerging of an immediate pause of Russian oil deliveries to the biggest refineries in India, Moscow’s biggest crude customer, and to China’s biggest state-owned oil companies. Luke Wickenden, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea), said: “If Moscow lost access to these markets, it could forfeit approximately $7.4bn in monthly revenue, translating to roughly $3.6bn in tax receipts per month flowing directly into the Kremlin’s war chest … If India alone were to cut its imports of Russian crude, the Kremlin could lose roughly $1.6bn in monthly tax revenues.” Putin’s top economic envoy has attempted to blame others after US-Russia relations chilled, the US imposed sanctions and Donald Trump cancelled a foreshadowed meeting in Budapest with the Russian ruler. Kirill Dmitriev alleged there had been “titanic attempts” to thwart US-Russia dialogue as he arrived in the US to meet members of the Trump administration. Trump initially gave a glowing assessment of his most recent conversation with Putin and said they would meet in Budapest. But a few days later, as Putin showed no sign of making concessions to end the war, Trump said the meeting would be a “waste of time” and he was personally disappointed at the Russian president."
world/2025/nov/13/ukraine-war-briefing-fire-sale-of-lukoil-assets-before-start-of-us-sanctions-on-russia,Ukraine war briefing: Fire sale of Lukoil assets before start of US sanctions on Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/13/ukraine-war-briefing-fire-sale-of-lukoil-assets-before-start-of-us-sanctions-on-russia,Ukraine war briefing: Fire sale of Lukoil assets before start of US sanctions on Russia,"The foreign oil refineries and other assets of Russian company Lukoil are attracting potential buyers as time runs out to strike cheap deals before US sanctions come into force on 21 November. The sanctions, put in place in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine, have already disrupted Lukoil’s operations in Iraq, at pump stations in Finland and a refinery in Bulgaria. Kazakhstan’s state firm KazMunayGas is studying a bid for Lukoil’s assets in the country, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Shell is interested in Lukoil deepwater assets in Ghana and Nigeria, two other sources said. Shell declined to comment to Reuters. The government of Moldova has started talks to nationalise Lukoil’s infrastructure at Chisinau airport, said the airport’s director, Serdgiu Spoiala. Bulgaria is working towards seizing and reselling Lukoil’s Burgas refinery, although Bulgaria’s president, Rumen Radev, has sent the legislation back to parliament asking for legal changes. In Egypt, Lukoil has indicated to the government its possible plans to sell out, a Reuters source familiar with the situation said. Lukoil holds three concessions in Egypt. Egypt’s petroleum ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Lukoil faces either selling its assets and having the proceeds potentially seized, or their takeover by foreign states if it does not sell them, said Sergey Vakulenko, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center and former head of strategy at Russian oil firm Gazprom Neft. Lukoil may try to emulate Russian oil firm Rosneft whose three German refineries were put under a trusteeship in 2022 – controlled by Berlin but still owned by Rosneft. Lukoil’s attempt to sell foreign assets to the Swiss-based oil trader Gunvor was scrapped after opposition from the US treasury which called Gunvor the Kremlin’s “puppet”. The Russian army overran three settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region of southern Ukraine, Kyiv’s top military commander, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Wednesday. Dense fog enabled Russian troops to infiltrate Ukrainian positions, he continued, adding that Ukrainian units were locked in “gruelling battles” to repel the Russian thrust. The fiercest battles remained in the besieged Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, in the Donetsk region, where close to half of all frontline clashes took place over the previous 24 hours. There was increased fighting also in the cities of Kupiansk and Lyman in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region. At Huliaipole, a Zaporizhzhia settlement where Syrskyi said the situation had worsened significantly, Reuters interviewed 84-year-old Polina Plyushchii as she sat bundled in layers of clothing and clutching her cane inside an evacuation van. Deadly threats including drones had made life too dangerous, she said. “You’re in your own house, your own yard – and you can’t go out,” she said, as Ukrainian rescuers race to get remaining civilians out of the line of fire. “There’s nowhere to buy medicine, there’s no water,” said evacuee Zhanna Puzanova, 55, adding both she and her 88-year-old mother were in poor health. “We can’t live like that any longer.” Vitaly Klitschko, the Kyiv mayor, has called for Ukraine to boost its fighting numbers by lowering the age of conscription. “In the past, 18-year-olds served in the army – but those are kids,” he said. “Right now you can only be mobilised in Ukraine from age 25. You could lower it by a year or two – to 23 or 22.” Klitschko spoke to a media network that includes Politico. The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said an energy corruption scandal in Ukraine was “extremely unfortunate” and it was important that Kyiv take it seriously. Luke Harding reports that Volodymyr Zelenskyy has moved to contain growing public outrage by firing two ministers who are accused of involvement in a large-scale bribery scheme. Ukraine’s president said the justice minister Herman Halushchenko and the energy minister Svitlana Grynchuk could no longer remain in their jobs. Ukraine’s president also called for personal sanctions against his friend and former business partner Timur Mindich, the scheme’s alleged organiser. “There must be maximum integrity in the energy sector, in absolutely all processes. I support every investigation carried out by law enforcement and anti-corruption officials. This is an absolutely clear and consistent position for everyone.” Mindich reportedly fled abroad, possibly to Israel, in the hours before investigators arrived at his Kyiv apartment to carry out a search. He was previously close to Zelenskyy, although sources say they have had little contact since Russia’s full-scale invasion."

Russia’s war is “a war against our democracy and a war against our freedom,” Merz said, adding that Moscow’s intention was to undermine unity in the bloc. He also referred to his recent endorsement of an EU plan to unlock frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine’s war effort, saying the move could provide military support for Ukraine for three to five years. Separately, German defence minister Boris Pistorius said Germany was ready to protect the Baltic region and would respond to Russia’s threats in a united and responsible manner. Pistorius, speaking at the opening of a Permanent Logistics Support Area in Rukla in Lithuania, said Germany was committed to strengthening deterrence, with roughly 2,000 troops to serve in Lithuania by mid-2026. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán said on Monday that Ukraine was not a sovereign country, as he hit back at accusations that Hungarian reconnaissance drones violated its airspace. “Ukraine is not at war with Hungary; it is at war with Russia. It should be concerned with the drones on its eastern border,” the Hungarian prime minister said during an interview on a right-wing podcast popular with his supporters. “I believe my ministers, but let’s say it would have actually flown a few metres there, so what? Ukraine is not an independent country. Ukraine is not a sovereign country, Ukraine is financed by us, the West gives it funds, weapons,” Orban said. On Friday, Zelenskiy said that reconnaissance drones that violated Ukraine’s airspace could have flown from Hungary to check the industrial potential of western border areas. Ukraine has proposed building a joint air defence shield with allies to protect against threats from Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday, after a series of airspace incursions that caused alarm on Nato’s eastern flank. “Ukraine proposes to Poland and all our partners to build a joint, fully reliable shield against Russian aerial threats,” he said in an address to the Warsaw Security Forum delivered via video link. “Ukraine can counter all kinds of Russian drones and missiles and if we act together in the region we will have enough weapons and production capacity.” The UK, France, Germany and Sweden said on Monday they would help Denmark increase its anti-drone security during two European summits in Copenhagen this week. Donald Tusk, Poland’s prime minister, said the scale of the recent drone incursions was such that “the entire western, transatlantic community” needed to realise “this is war”. A Russian overnight drone strike killed a family of four in the north-eastern Sumy region on Tuesday, the head of the regional military administration said. Oleg Grygorov said Russian forces had hit a residential building in the village of Chernechchyna, in the Krasnopillia community. “A couple with two young children lived in this house. Unfortunately, no one managed to escape,” Grygorov wrote on the Telegram platform. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Russian forces are prevailing in what he said was a “righteous battle” in Ukraine. “Our fighters and commanders go on the attack, and the entire country, all of Russia, is waging this righteous battle and working hard,” Putin said in a video published on the Kremlin’s website. “Together we are defending our love for the motherland and the unity of our historical destiny, we are fighting and we are prevailing.” Separately Putin on Monday called up 135,000 men for routine military service, the country’s biggest autumn conscription drive since 2016. Russia calls up men aged between 18 and 30 for compulsory military service each spring and autumn. Conscripts are expected to serve for a year at a military base inside Russia, not to fight in Ukraine, although there have been reports of conscripted men being sent to the frontline. Russia’s annual conscription campaigns are unrelated to mobilisation, in which Russian men are drafted to fight during wartime. Also on Monday Putin signed a law to pull Russia out of a European anti-torture convention. Russia was expelled from the Council of Europe, an international human-rights monitor, in March 2022, though it had technically remained a party to its European Convention for the Prevention of Torture. The landmark agreement aims to strengthen the rights of persons deprived of their liberty and empowers monitors to visit prisons and detention centres. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has now been without offsite power for six days, the UN atomic watchdog’s chief Rafael Grossi said on Monday. The plant in southeastern Ukraine has been under Russian control since the early weeks of the war, and each side has repeatedly accused the other of shelling it and jeopardising nuclear safety. The IAEA said the external power lines supplying the plant came down last week for the 10th time in the conflict and emergency diesel generators were brought into service. The Council of Europe on Monday awarded its 2025 rights prize to Ukrainian journalist and rights activist Maksym Butkevych, who was released last year after being captured by Russian forces. Butkevych, co-founder of the independent Hromadske radio station and ZMINA human rights centre in Kyiv, joined the Ukrainian army in March 2022, then was detained in June and convicted of war crimes by a court in Luhansk in Russian-controlled eastern Ukraine in March 2023. He was sentenced to a 13-year prison term on charges of wounding two civilians while firing an anti-tank grenade launcher in the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk, but he was released during an October 2024 prisoner exchange."
world/2025/nov/06/ukraine-forever-war-europe-steps-up-pressure-russia-former-nato-chief,"Ukraine faces ‘forever war’ unless Europe steps up pressure on Russia, says ex-Nato chief",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/ukraine-forever-war-europe-steps-up-pressure-russia-former-nato-chief,"Ukraine faces ‘forever war’ unless Europe steps up pressure on Russia, says ex-Nato chief","Ukraine is facing a “forever war” and a slow erosion of territory unless Europe dramatically increases pressure on Russia, including by deploying troops and establishing a missile and drone shield on Nato territory to protect Ukraine from Russian attacks on its infrastructure, a former Nato secretary general has said. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who held the Nato post from 2009 to 2014 and was the prime minister of Denmark from 2001 to 2009, said in an interview with the Guardian that if countries such as Poland agreed to host such air defences, Russia would understand that an attack on them would be an attack on the whole of the Nato alliance. He said: “We have to help the Ukrainian [people] protect themselves against Russian missiles and drones by building an air shield helping the Ukrainians shoot down Russian missiles and drones. Nato countries neighbouring Ukraine can be the location for a Nato-based air defence and missile system.” Rasmussen also called for the deployment of a European protection force for Ukraine in advance of a ceasefire agreement. He said the “coalition of the willing” hoping to assemble such a force for when fighting ends had been reduced to a coalition of the waiting. “If we do not carry out major changes in strategy we will look into a forever war,” he said. “Putin has no incentive to engage in peace negotiations so long as he thinks he can win on the battlefield. Changes in speed and mindset are needed.” Rasmussen, who has forged close links with the Ukrainian leadership, is touring European capitals, including London to meet the UK national security adviser, Jonathan Powell. The two men discussed whether the US could provide security guarantees to Ukraine, using language similar to that recently used by the US when it provided security guarantees to Qatar after Israel attacked its capital, Doha. Iron-clad security guarantees would make it easier for Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, to sell a peace deal to his own people that involved the loss of Ukrainian territory, Rasmussen said. He said it was necessary to make dramatic adjustments to force a change in Vladimir Putin’s mindset. Apart from the development of a Ukrainian missile and drone shield based in Europe, and the deployment of some European troops into Ukraine, he urged Ukraine to be given long-range missiles to hit more targets inside Russia. He said it was still possible to reopen discussions on the supply of US Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, which Donald Trump has not backed, if Germany was willing to be “the first mover” and provide Ukraine with its own Taurus cruise missiles. He said: “That would send a clear signal across the Atlantic and put pressure on the White House. It is a strong German interest to force Putin to engage in peace negotiations … Taurus is the means to do so.” Trump’s approach to Ukraine is in limbo after the US president appeared to step back from supplying Tomahawk missiles and announced instead a second summit with Putin. Trump later cancelled that meeting, saying he did not believe the Russian president was serious about peace, and imposed economic sanctions against the largest Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. He appears overall to have reverted to a position whereby the two sides have to be left to fight it out. Rasmussen said Europe was still not waking up to the threat posed by Russia and urged the use of frozen Russian assets for Ukraine. “We need to defreeze the frozen €150bn [£132bn] Russian assets in Euroclear and use the assets as the basis for a loan to purchase weapons and hopefully start reconstruction,” he said. He predicted European leaders would be able to overcome objections to this plan voiced at the last EU council of ministers, principally by Belgium, where Euroclear is based. The plan rests on the assumption that neither Ukraine nor the EU would need to repay the loan but could instead draw on a proposed Russian payment of war reparations to Ukraine. Belgium, however, is saying there is no guarantee reparations will be paid as a part of a ceasefire and it may require all EU states to provide guarantees to Belgium about the loan’s repayment."

A Ukrainian security official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the drones, launched by Ukraine’s SBU intelligence service and military special forces, hit at least five reservoirs. The source said drones also hit at least two Russian electrical substations on the peninsula, which Russia took from Ukraine in 2014. Large heat signatures around the Feodosia terminal were visible on Nasa’s satellite fire monitoring service, Firms, and Crimea’s Moscow-installed governor confirmed the fire. The Feodosia terminal also came under attack last week. Ukraine has launched more than 30 strikes on Russian energy sites since the beginning of August, aiming to hamper funding of the Kremlin’s war machine and also triggering a spike in petrol prices inside Russia. Crimea is among areas that have been hit by fuel shortages and rationing as Russia has lost refining capacity in Ukrainian attacks. Russian forces attacked Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, with guided bombs on Monday, knocking out power to 30,000 customers, local officials said. The mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said the three bombs damaged a hospital and hit power transmission lines. Four people were injured, mostly by flying glass. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced he will travel to the US this week for talks on the potential US provision of long-range weapons, after Donald Trump said he might supply Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles. Zelenskyy said a meeting with Trump might take place on Friday and he would also meet with defence and energy companies and members of Congress. Zelenskyy spoke at a meeting with the EU foreign minister, Kaja Kallas. He said he also would seek further US assistance to protect Ukraine’s electricity and gas networks amid Russian bombardment. Zelenskyy will join a Ukrainian delegation already in the US led by Yulia Svyrydenko, the prime minister. Kallas said on Monday that the EU had started funding a special tribunal to prosecute the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and other senior Russian officials for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. “We are also calling on other member states, countries, participants to fund it so that the work can really start full-scale because without accountability there is no just and lasting peace.” Russia’s defence ministry on Monday said its forces had captured two villages in eastern Ukraine: one in the Donetsk region and the other near Kupiansk in the north-east, a largely destroyed city under attack for months. The first corps of Ukraine’s national guard said it had repelled a new attempt by Russian forces to make advances near the town of Dobropillia, which is in the Donetsk region near the logistics hub of Pokrovsk. These versions of events on the battlefield were not independently confirmed. Russia poses a direct threat and the “icy peace” with the EU could erupt into “direct military confrontation”, Germany’s foreign intelligence chief has warned. Martin Jaeger, head of the BND spy service, told lawmakers that Russia was determined to expand its “sphere of influence further westward into Europe”. Jaeger said Germany was Russia’s “number one target in Europe” given that it was the largest EU economy and played a “leading role in supporting Ukraine”. The warnings come after incidents in the EU including the incursion of Russian drones into Poland, the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets, and suspected Russian involvement in drone flights that shut down airports. “We must not sit back and assume that a possible Russian attack would come in 2029 at the earliest,” Jaeger said, referring to an earlier intelligence assessment. “We are already under fire today … The means Moscow uses are well known: attempted manipulation of elections and public opinion, propaganda, provocations, disinformation, espionage, sabotage, airspace violations by drones and fighter jets, contract killings, persecution of opposition figures living abroad.”"

Ukraine has accused the man of passing information to Moscow about other foreign military advisers in Ukraine and the coordinates of army training centres. The Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office alleged he arrived in Ukraine in 2024, conducted military training for the army and worked in the border guard before agreeing to collaborate with Moscow. Ukraine’s state security service, the SBU, alleges the Russian FSB spy bureau gave the man instructions on making explosive devices and also provided him with a handgun and ammunition, while the prosecutor general claimed he “attempted to establish access to the command of military units” in exchange for $6,000. He faces up to 12 years in prison if found guilty. Britain’s Foreign Office told Agence France-Presse that it was “aware of reports that a British national has been detained in Ukraine … We remain in close contact with the Ukrainian authorities.” Russia launched an overnight attack on the north-eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, injuring 11 residents including four children in a residential multi-storey building, private houses and infrastructure facilities, Ukraine’s emergency services said on Friday. The local governor, Ihor Kalchenko, said the railway depot was hit, destroying several carriages and damaging buildings. The Russian western city of Oryol restricted supply of heat and hot water after Ukrainian drones hit a pipeline at a power plant on Friday, local authorities said. “It will be necessary to limit the heat and hot water supply to buildings in the Sovetsky, Zheleznodorozhny and Severny districts of the city of Oryol,” the governor of the Oryol region, Andrey Klychkov, wrote on social media. Russia has in recent months attacked Ukraine with its 9M729 cruise missile whose secret development prompted Donald Trump to abandon a nuclear arms control pact with Moscow in his first term as US president, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha. His comments are the first confirmation that Russia has used the ground-launched missile in combat. Russia has fired the missile at Ukraine 23 times since August, a second senior Ukrainian official told Reuters. Russia’s defence ministry did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment. Japanese utilities JERA and Tohoku Electric Power Co, buyers of liquefied natural gas from Russia’s Sakhalin-2, can secure alternative supplies if flows are interrupted, executives said, amid US pressure to end energy imports from Russia. JERA gets about 2m tonnes of LNG per year from the project under two contracts ending in 2026 and 2029. JERA also handles 30m-35m tonnes both for domestic use and to resell elsewhere. Pjotr Sauer writes that Russian commanders are executing or deliberately sending to their deaths soldiers who refuse to fight in Ukraine, according to a new investigation by the award-winning independent outlet Verstka, which paints a bleak picture of internal violence within the Russian army. Verstka cited testimonies from soldiers who said commanders had appointed “execution shooters” to open fire on refusers and later dump their bodies in rivers or shallow graves, registering them as killed in action. Other accounts describe commanders using drones and explosives to “finish off” wounded or retreating soldiers. Russia launched a barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine’s energy infrastructure and other targets, forcing nationwide power restrictions and killing seven people including a seven-year-old girl, Ukrainian officials said on Thursday. Regional officials said two energy facilities in the western Lviv region had been damaged. DTEK, Ukraine’s largest private energy company, said its thermal power stations in a number of regions were under attack. “This attack is a bad blow to our efforts to keep power flowing this winter,” said Maxim Timchenko, DTEK’s CEO. The Ukraine government announced nationwide limits on electricity supplies to retail and industrial consumers. In some regions, water supplies and heating were also disrupted. The attacks hit energy facilities in central, western, and south-eastern regions, Ukrainian officials said. Regional officials said two men were killed in the south-eastern industrial city of Zaporizhzhia, and a seven-year-old girl from the central Vinnytsia region died in hospital from her injuries. The regional governor said a later drone strike on a village south of Zaporizhzhia killed one person and injured another. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, said in his nightly video address that a bomb hit a thermal power plant in Sloviansk in eastern Donetsk region, killing two people and injuring others. Prosecutors in Donetsk region said Russian attacks on dwellings in the city of Kramatorsk killed one person and injured three. Zelenskyy said Russia launched more than 650 drones and 50 missiles in the attacks. Most of the drones were neutralised and two-thirds of the missiles were downed, he said. Air defence units shot down 592 drones and 31 missiles, the air force said. In Sumy, a city near the northern border with Russia, the regional governor said 10 Russian drones attacked the city in an hour early on Friday. Two people were injured when two apartment buildings were hit and pictures posted online showed several apartments ablaze. Air alerts lasted nearly the entire night in Kyiv, where residents took shelter in deep underground metro stations. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had been attacking facilities of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex. Moscow denies targeting civilians and has said its strikes are responses to Ukraine’s attacks on Russian infrastructure; however, Russian missiles and drones frequently, conspicuously and directly hit civilian homes and facilities. Ukraine has launched regular drone attacks on military and oil sites that it says support the war. “[Russia’s] goal is to plunge Ukraine into darkness. Ours is to preserve the light,” said the Ukrainian prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko. “To stop the terror, we need more air defence systems, tougher sanctions, and maximum pressure on the aggressor.”"

It was not clear whether Washington will actually levy further sanctions, but some of the measures being discussed reportedly included targeting Russia’s banking sector and the infrastructure used to get oil to market, said a US official and another person familiar with the matter. Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Russia on Wednesday for the first time since returning to office in January. Trump said on Saturday that he would not schedule any talks with Putin unless it was clear that the Russian leader was serious about making a deal to end the war in Ukraine. “I’m going to have to know that we’re going to make a deal. I’m not going to be wasting my time,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he headed to Asia. “I’ve always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing,” Trump said, adding, “I thought this would have gotten done before peace in the Middle East.” An overnight Russian drone attack on Kyiv killed three people and wounded dozens, the mayor of the Ukrainian capital said on Sunday. “According to preliminary information, three people died and 27 were wounded (including 6 children),” Vitali Klitschko wrote on Telegram. It comes a day after Russian missile and drone attacks on Saturday killed at least four people and wounded 20, officials said. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched nine missiles and 62 drones, of which four missiles and 50 drones were intercepted. In the capital, Kyiv, two people were killed and 13 were wounded in a ballistic missile attack in the early hours of Saturday, Kyiv’s police said. A fire broke out in a nonresidential building in one location, while debris from intercepted missiles fell in an open area at another site, damaging windows in nearby buildings, Ukraine’s state emergency service wrote on the messaging app Telegram. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, two people were killed and seven wounded, the acting regional governor, Vladyslav Haivanenko, said, adding that apartment buildings and private homes were damaged in the strikes. In Russia, the defence ministry said its air defences shot down 121 Ukrainian drones over Russia overnight. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Saturday that Russia’s attacks intensified Ukraine’s need for Patriot defence systems. “It is precisely because of such attacks that we pay special attention to Patriot systems – to be able to protect our cities from this horror. It is critical that partners who possess relevant capability implement what we have discussed in recent days,” he wrote in English on X, adding “America, Europe and the G7 countries can help ensure that such attacks no longer threaten lives.”"

Ukrainian Foreign Intelligence Agency official Oleh Alexandrov told the state news agency Ukrinform that China was passing on satellite intelligence on targets, including those benefiting from foreign investment. “There is evidence of a high level of cooperation between Russia and China in conducting satellite reconnaissance of the territory of Ukraine in order to identify and further explore strategic objects for targeting,” he said. “As we have seen in recent months, these sites may belong to foreign investors.” Ukraine’s air force said in the early morning on Sunday all of the country was under threat of fresh Russian missile attacks, following hours of air raid alerts and warnings of drone and missile attacks. Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, a western Ukrainian city about 70km (43 miles) from the border with Poland, said missiles were approaching the city after air defence systems were already engaged heavily in repelling a Russian drone attack. Poland scrambled jets early on Sunday after the airstrikes on western Ukraine. “Polish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, while ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems have been brought to the highest state of readiness,” Poland’s operational command said in a post on X. According to flight tracking service Flightradar24, early on Sunday, commercial flights were using routings typically used when Poland’s Lublin and Rzeszow airports near the border with Ukraine were closed. Lithuania suspended air traffic at Vilnius airport due to balloons possibly flying in its airspace on Saturday, and flights have been diverted to neighbouring Poland and Latvia. Lithuania, a strong supporter of Ukraine, shares a 679km border with Belarus, a close ally of Russia. The incursion into Lithuania follows drone sightings and air incursions at airports in Copenhagen and Munich in recent weeks. A Russian “combined strike” killed a woman and wounded six other people in Zaporizhzhia, Ivan Fedorov, the head of the south-eastern Ukrainian region, said on Telegram. A 16-year-old girl was among those receiving “necessary assistance” from medical personnel after the attack, Fedorov said. One person was killed and about 30 others injured after two Russian drones struck trains at a station in Ukraine’s northern Sumy region. The region’s governor, Oleh Hryhorov, said eight people had been taken to hospital. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called the attack “brutal” on Telegram, posting a video of a wrecked, burning passenger carriage and others with their windows blown out. “The Russians could not have been unaware that they were targeting civilians. This is terrorism, which the world has no right to ignore,” Zelenskyy wrote. The head of Ukraine’s railways, Oleksandr Pertsovsky, said Russia was intensifying a campaign of airstrikes on the network in an attempt to isolate frontline communities ahead of winter. “We clearly see the intensification of enemy attacks on the railway infrastructure,” Pertsovsky told reporters. “There is no military purpose whatsoever. The only purpose is to sow panic among people … That the connection will be destroyed and people will be left alone.” The Ukrainian military on Saturday reported it again hit one of Russia’s largest oil refineries. It said a night-time drone strike caused blasts and a fire at the Kirishi refinery near St Petersburg, more than 1,200km (745 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Telegram news channels from Russia and Ukraine posted videos they said had been sent in by residents near the city of Kirishi. They show drone-like objects whizzing against a night sky lit up by an orange glow, as blasts thunder in the background. The local governor, Alexander Drozdenko, on Saturday reported that seven drones were shot down overnight near Kirishi. He said a fire had been put out in its “industrial zone”, without specifying what was hit or commenting on damage. Ukraine has repeatedly struck the Kirishi refinery, with the most recent strike on 14 September also sparking a blaze, according to Russian officials. Populist billionaire Andrej Babiš’s triumph in the Czech parliamentary elections is expected to reduce the EU member country’s support for Ukraine. Babiš has said he would review a Czech-led international drive to supply artillery shells to Ukraine, launched by the previous government, and “discuss it with President Zelenskyy” if necessary. “We are clearly pro-European and pro-Nato,” he added to dispel fears he might draw the Czech Republic closer to EU mavericks Hungary and Slovakia, refusing military aid to Ukraine and opposing sanctions on Russia."
world/2025/nov/11/ukraine-war-briefing-battle-for-pokrovsk-raging-on-as-russia-claims-advance-on-town-to-east,Ukraine war briefing: battle for Pokrovsk ‘raging on’ as Russia claims advance on town to east,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/11/ukraine-war-briefing-battle-for-pokrovsk-raging-on-as-russia-claims-advance-on-town-to-east,Ukraine war briefing: battle for Pokrovsk ‘raging on’ as Russia claims advance on town to east,"Ukraine and Russia have issued conflicting accounts of fighting around Myrnohrad, an embattled town to the east of Pokrovsk, which Moscow’s forces have enveloped from almost all sides. The Ukrainian military said on Facebook on Monday that it had delivered supplies into Myrnohrad and rotated out troops fighting in the town, including those who were wounded. “Ukrainian units are confidently holding their positions and destroying the occupiers on the approaches to the town,” the statement said. “Logistics to the town are complicated, but are being carried out.” Russia’s defence ministry said on Telegram that its forces were advancing on the town, noting gains in two of its districts. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces were holding their positions around Pokrovsk and Dobropillia, a town to the north, where Kyiv says its troops have made gains. Ukraine’s top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said Russia was concentrating about 150,000 troops on a drive to capture Pokrovsk, dubbed “the gateway to Donetsk” and in Russia’s sights for more than a year as it pushes to control the whole eastern Donetsk region. Mechanised groups and marine brigades were part of Russia’s push, he told the New York Post. “There are ongoing battles and fights raging on. There are fast manoeuvres carried out by the enemy all the time.”The battlefield reports could not be independently verified. Russian troops were also advancing on villages in the Zaporizhzhia region further south, frontline reports suggested. The Russian defence ministry said two villages there – north-east of the town of Hulyaipole – were among the three it had captured along the 1,000km (620-mile) front line over the past 24 hours. Ukraine’s DeepState military blog noted “a significant increase in grey zones”, with uncertain control in Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine’s anti-corruption bureau said on Monday that it was conducting a large-scale investigation into the country’s energy sector, alleging kickbacks in transactions involving the state nuclear power operator, Energoatom. Luke Harding reports that the bureau, which operates independently of the government, alleged that several senior figures were involved. Ukrainian media identified one of them as Timur Mindich, a businessman and associate of Ukraine’s president Zelenskyy. Mindich reportedly fled abroad hours before investigators arrived at his Kyiv apartment to carry out a search. Germany will increase financial aid to Ukraine to €11.5bn ($13.41bn) in the 2026 budget, up from €8.5bn previously planned, according to budget documents seen by Reuters on Monday. Germany is Europe’s largest contributor of military aid to Ukraine, having provided around €40bn euros since Russia’s 2022 invasion. Ukraine’s special forces said they had hit a pumping station at a Russian oil depot in the occupied Crimean peninsula overnight. “The Hvardiyska oil depot is an important element of the fuel logistics system of the occupying authorities in Crimea,” the special forces said on Telegram on Monday. “It is important for supplying military facilities and transport of the enemy army.” Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack damaged civilian infrastructure in the Saratov region, the governor of the western Russian region said on Tuesday. “All emergency services were deployed to the scene,” Roman Basurgin said on Telegram. Belgium has enlisted the help of foreign armed forces to seize or track down drones that have made incursions around its airports, military bases and a nuclear plant, with officials saying it all bears the hallmarks of Russian interference. “We’re not saying it’s Russia – we’re saying it looks like Russia,” said a Belgian official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ‘It’s impossible to connect any incident with an actor. We have nothing.” The official said Belgium was “working with partners to try to get our hands on a drone, or detect where it is launched from and where it’s going”. Russia has denied involvement with the drones. Lukoil declared force majeure at its Iraqi oil field, sources told Reuters on Monday, and Bulgaria was poised to seize its Burgas refinery, as the Russian company’s international operations buckled under the strain of US sanctions. The force majeure at the West Qurna-2 field in Iraq marks the biggest fallout yet from the sanctions imposed on Russian oil majors Lukoil and Rosneft last month as part of US president Donald Trump’s push to end the war in Ukraine."
world/2025/aug/20/what-are-the-prospects-of-a-ceasefire-in-the-russia-ukraine-war,What are the prospects of a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/20/what-are-the-prospects-of-a-ceasefire-in-the-russia-ukraine-war,What are the prospects of a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war?,"For six months Donald Trump has been calling for a ceasefire in Ukraine. His position abruptly changed after his summit last week with Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The US now supports a final settlement of the war first, which is Russia’s negotiating position. What changed? And where does Trump’s latest flip-flop leave prospects for an end to the fighting? How did Trump’s view on a ceasefire in Ukraine change? Since spring the White House has been urging Russia to accept a ceasefire in Ukraine. As Donald Trump put it in March: “I think the ceasefire is very important. If we can get Russia to do it, that’ll be great.” The US president threatened to impose sanctions on Moscow, and on buyers of its oil such as India, if it refused. He gave various deadlines, which came and went. Until last week the US continued its demand for a 30-day pause in the fighting, to which Kyiv agreed. Speaking on his plane to Alaska on Friday, before a meeting with Putin, Trump repeated his demand. There would be “severe consequences” if a ceasefire didn’t happen. “I’m not going to be happy,” he said. The US president’s position dramatically shifted after meeting Putin. Exactly why is uncertain. But in the face of Russian opposition, Trump dropped his call for a ceasefire and instead embraced the Kremlin’s preferred “plan” to end the war. This envisages a comprehensive peace settlement first. Until that happens, Moscow will carry on bombing. Trump also agreed to Russia’s territorial claims. Putin wants Ukraine to cede the northern part of Donetsk oblast – including the fortress cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk – which Russian troops have been unable to conquer since 2014. By way of a so-called concession, Russia reportedly said it would freeze the frontlines in southern Zaporizhzhia and Kherson provinces. The change in US policy on a Ukraine ceasefire was the summit’s most significant outcome. It amounts to a major concession to the Russians. In his meeting on Monday with Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, Trump explained his new way of thinking. He said there was no need for a truce and claimed he had ended six conflicts without one. “I didn’t do any ceasefire,” he said. He said he would still “like them [the Russians] to stop” but said a pause in hostilities might disadvantage “one side or the other”. What is the Russian position? Russia wants to continue its war. Over the summer Russian troops have seized villages in the Donbas, and have entered the Dnipropetrovsk region – which borders Donetsk oblast – for the first time. Russia’s progress is gradual and achieved with heavy casualties. Putin believes he is winning and that time is on his side. His maximalist demands are unchanged since the 2022 invasion. He wants Zelenskyy removed, severe limits put on the size of Ukraine’s army, and a veto on its Nato membership. Any ceasefire would in effect divide territory along the existing 1,000km frontline. A permanent peace plan, by contrast, could involve one side giving land to the other as part of a deal. Putin’s conditions are unacceptable to Kyiv, and amount to Ukraine’s surrender. Ukrainians believe he is using Trump to take what Russian forces have been unable to capture on the battlefield – with DC the quickest route to victory in Donetsk. When negotiations fail – the most likely outcome in the short term – Putin will inevitably blame Zelenskyy. Where does this leave Ukraine and its allies? Frustrated. European leaders have urged Trump to put pressure on Russia to agree a ceasefire before any negotiations take place. On Monday, they reinforced this message in the White House. Britain’s Keir Starmer joined Zelenskyy in Washington, with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Finland, Nato and the EU. Their task was to protect Zelenskyy – in the end his meeting with Trump went better than the last encounter in February – and to tactfully convey Ukraine and Europe’s principled anti-landgrab position. The Europeans are opposed to any deal that would reward Russian aggression. Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, expressed his support for a ceasefire. “Let’s work on that and let’s try to put pressure on Russia,” the German leader told Trump. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said European governments would eventually need to be included in any peace talks. After Trump’s unexplained U-turn, Ukraine’s EU allies are using a new formula to try to win him over to the idea of a ceasefire – “stop the killing”. What does history tell us? Wars can stop without formal peace treaties. In 1953 an armistice ended the war between North and South Korea. It established a demilitarised zone between the two states, the DMZ, dividing the peninsula. Military commanders from the US, China and North Korea signed the deal. South Korea’s leader refused, because it left Korea split. Technically, the two Koreas are still in a state of war. The ceasefire, though, has lasted more than eight decades, despite breaches by Pyongyang. This model could work in Ukraine. No Ukrainian government is likely to accept Russian occupation over parts of its territory. But it might be prepared to acknowledge the Kremlin’s de facto control as part of temporary settlement. Putin, however, is against the idea of a Korea-style armistice. His goal is to subjugate Ukraine – all of it, or as much as he can get – and to fold it into a reinvigorated greater Russia."
world/2025/aug/21/ukraine-war-briefing-coalition-of-the-willing-talks-held-as-russia-stalls,Ukraine war briefing: ‘Coalition of the willing’ talks held as Russia stalls,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/21/ukraine-war-briefing-coalition-of-the-willing-talks-held-as-russia-stalls,Ukraine war briefing: ‘Coalition of the willing’ talks held as Russia stalls,"Work is under way on the military component of security guarantees for Ukraine that European leaders and Donald Trump have committed to if there is a peace deal. A small group of military leaders held discussions in Washington to work out options, a western official told Reuters on Wednesday, shortly after a bigger virtual meeting wrapped up. Gen Dan Caine, chair of the US joint chiefs of staff, held the talks, which also involved around half a dozen other Nato defence chiefs. The chair of the Nato military committee, Adm Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, called it a “great, candid discussion … Priority continues to be a just, credible and durable peace”. As the “coalition of the willing” began to take on a preliminary shape, Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Ukraine was also working on a plan with its allies on how to proceed “in case the Russian side continues to prolong the war and disrupt agreements on bilateral and trilateral formats of leaders’ meetings”. Yermak said: “Our teams, above all the military, have already begun active work on the military component of security guarantees.” Russia, meanwhile, continued to display its apparent intention to delay a possible meeting between Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy, writes Pjotr Sauer. Sergei Lavrov, Putin’s foreign minister, complained on Wednesday that Moscow should be included in any talks on Ukraine’s security guarantees: “To discuss security guarantees seriously without Russia is a road to nowhere.” Russia gave Ukraine a supposed “security guarantee” under the Budapest memorandum of 1994, which Putin has long since comprehensively violated by attacking Ukraine. Lavrov avoided any direct reference to a possible Putin-Zelenskyy summit and said China, Russia’s ally in the war, should be among Ukraine’s security guarantors. Kyiv is likely to view that with deep scepticism, given that Russia uses equipment and materials from China to attack Ukraine, and that the two countries have vowed to pursue a “no-limits” partnership. Analysts suggested Putin would probably only meet Zelenskyy to accept a complete Ukrainian capitulation. Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said: “He has repeatedly stated that such a meeting would only be possible if there were well-prepared grounds, which in practice means Zelenskyy’s acceptance of Russia’s terms for ending the war.” Drones attacked Kyiv over Wednesday night into Thursday morning as the Ukrainian air force issued a national alert for missile attacks after Russian warplanes took off. Earlier on Wednesday, at least three people were killed in a Russian artillery attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Kostiantynivka, local officials said. Another four were wounded. The governor, Vadym Filashkin, said it involved eight strikes from a multiple rocket launch system and targeted a local market. At least 14 people, including a family with three children, were wounded in a Russian attack on Ukraine’s northern region of Sumy. A “massive drone strike” on the southern Ukrainian region of Odesa injured one person and caused a large fire at a fuel and energy facility, Ukraine’s state emergency service said on Wednesday. Ukrainian drone forces, meanwhile, scored a major hit on the Novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in Russia’s Rostov region, where fires and explosions were captured on video. A Russian military drone exploded in Polish farmland, also on Wednesday, blowing the windows out of houses and igniting a furious response from authorities. “Once again, we are facing a provocation from the Russian Federation, with a Russian drone,” said Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, the Polish defence minister. The explosion was in a cornfield near the village of Osiny, about 100km (60 miles) from Warsaw and near the borders with Ukraine and Russian-allied Belarus. Poland’s foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, condemned “a new violation of our airspace from the east … The foreign ministry will protest to the perpetrator of this violation.” It was believed to be a Russian drone type called Gerbera, which is often used as a decoy in attacks against Ukraine. Poland’s Gen Dariusz Malinowski said the aircraft “was a decoy drone, which was not armed but carried a self-destruct warhead”. Russian drones and missiles have crossed into the airspace of Nato members Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania several times in the three and a half years since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. The latest incident comes less than a month after a Russian military drone flew into Lithuania from Belarus."
world/2025/sep/05/russia-prosthetic-limbs-manufacture-ukraine-war,"Russia is leader in prosthetic limbs thanks to Ukraine war, says Kremlin official ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/05/russia-prosthetic-limbs-manufacture-ukraine-war,"Russia is leader in prosthetic limbs thanks to Ukraine war, says Kremlin official ","A Kremlin official has said that the number of soldiers wounded fighting in Ukraine had helped to make Russia a world leader in the manufacture of prosthetic limbs. Deputy defence minister Anna Tsivilyova, reportedly a relative of President Vladimir Putin, told a conference in Vladivostok that those coming back from the battlefield had become a “driver” in pushing Russia’s innovation in prosthetics. “We are probably leading in this direction now,” she said at the Eastern Economic Forum. “It is precisely the participants in the special military operation who have allowed us to reach such a priority flagship level,” she said, using Russia’s term for its invasion of Ukraine. Putin said last year that about 700,000 Russian troops were fighting in Ukraine, but Moscow has kept the number of soldiers killed or wounded in its invasion top secret and rarely discloses information about casualties. According to the British Ministry of Defence, more than one million Russian troops have been killed or injured since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022. That estimate aligns with a recent study by the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), which puts Russian military deaths at up to 250,000 and total casualties, including the wounded, at over 950,000. Signs of the high casualty rate can be seen in Russia’s booming funeral industry – between January and April 2025, funeral service providers saw a 12.7% year-on-year increase in earnings – and the rising number of veterans returning home without arms or legs. Russian government data shows it issued 60,000 more prosthetic limbs in 2024 than in 2021 – a 65% increase. Tsivilyova has been sanctioned by the United States, European Union and Britain for her role in Russia’s offensive on Ukraine. She is the reportedly the daughter of Putin’s first cousin, with the UK naming her “Putin’s first cousin once removed” and the EU listing her as a “close relative” of the Kremlin leader.

world/2025/aug/18/ukraine-war-briefing-security-guarantees-on-offer-but-russia-wants-some-too,Ukraine war briefing: ‘Security guarantees’ on offer but Russia wants some too,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/18/ukraine-war-briefing-security-guarantees-on-offer-but-russia-wants-some-too,Ukraine war briefing: ‘Security guarantees’ on offer but Russia wants some too,"Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed the decision to offer security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal as he prepared to meet Donald Trump in Washington on Monday. “Security guarantees, as a result of our joint work, must really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air and at sea, and must be developed with Europe’s participation,” said the Ukrainian president. Trump’s Ukraine envoy, the real estate developer Steve Witkoff, said Vladimir Putin had agreed that the US and European allies could offer Ukraine a Nato-style, “Article 5-like” security guarantee as part of an eventual deal to end the war. It appeared to be a major shift for Putin, but Witkoff has previously got it wrong when announcing what has been agreed in talks with the Russians – he does not speak Russian and has walked into meetings with Vladimir Putin without a translator of his own. Russia agrees that any future peace agreement on Ukraine must provide security guarantees to Kyiv but Moscow also needs credible security assurances, Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s envoy to international organisations in Vienna, said early on Monday. “Many leaders of EU states emphasise that a future peace agreement should provide reliable security assurances or guarantees for Ukraine,” Ulyanov said. “Russia agrees with that. But it has equal right to expect that Moscow will also get efficient security guarantees.” Russia has not been invaded by another country since the end of the second world war – apart from the humiliating Ukrainian counter-invasion of Kursk – while having repeatedly invaded other countries and illegally annexed their territory. European heavyweight leaders will join Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House meeting with Trump on Monday, writes Luke Harding, in an extraordinary joint effort to push back on a US-backed plan that would allow Russia to take further Ukrainian territory. They are expected to argue against a land swap plan that rewards Russian aggression, and to seek further clarity on what security guarantees the US is willing to offer in the event of a settlement. The delegation includes the French president, Emmanuel Macron; Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz; Italy’s PM, Giorgia Meloni; Keir Starmer, the British PM; Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte; the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen; and the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb. In a CBS interview after the Trump-Putin talks in Alaska, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, gave short shrift to the Russian ruler’s “long historical complaint” that “root causes” of the Ukraine war must be addressed as part of a peace deal. “We’re not going to focus on all of that stuff. We’re going to focus on this: are they going to stop fighting or not? And what it’s going to take to stop the fighting.” Rubio continued: “If we’re being honest and serious here, both sides are going to have to give, and both sides should expect to get something from this. And that’s a very difficult thing to do … Ukraine obviously feels, you know, harmed, and rightfully so, because they were invaded. And the Russian side, because they feel like they got momentum in the battlefield, and frankly, don’t care, don’t seem to care very much about how many Russian soldiers die in this endeavour.” Dan Sabbagh writes that Rubio gave the inbound European delegation some hope, insisting to NBC that a ceasefire is “not off the table” – despite Putin insisting it can only come after a complete peace deal – and confirming that the US is interested in contributing to western security guarantees to Ukraine. “It’s one of their fundamental demands is that if this war were to end, they have to make sure this never happens again.” The US secretary of state is a traditional Republican whose instincts towards Russia are hawkish, although he has a record of going with the flow when it comes to the president’s impulses. Russian attacks on Ukraine continued over Sunday night. A missile strike on Kharkiv city injured 11 people, said Kharkiv’s mayor. A guided bomb strike on a Sumy oblast community left a woman injured, said the head of the regional military administration, while civilian facilities were damaged in a series of attacks."

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Telegram 277 Ukrainian service personnel had returned home from Russian captivity. Russia’s defence ministry said 246 servicemen had been handed over by Kyiv. It said a further 31 injured prisoners of war had been handed over to Ukraine and 15 of its own wounded servicemen had also been returned by Kyiv. Zelenskyy thanked the United Arab Emirates for its mediation, saying a total of 4,552 Ukrainians – service personnel and civilians – had been returned since the start of Russia’s invasion in February 2022. Fighting has continued in Russia’s border regions despite Vladimir Putin’s declaration of an Easter ceasefire, Zelenskyy has said. “Kursk and Belgorod regions – Putin’s Easter statements did not spread to this territory,” Ukraine’s president said on X, referring to parts of Russia where Ukraine troops are present. “Fighting continues, Russian strikes continue.” Moscow’s troops have driven out Ukrainian forces from nearly all of the Kursk region, Russia’s chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, has said. “The bulk of the area where the invasion took place has now been cleared,” Gerasimov told Putin in a televised meeting. “It’s 1,260 sq km, 99.5%.” The RIA state news agency cited the Russian defence ministry as saying on Saturday that Russian troops recaptured the village of Oleshnya in Kursk. Zelenskyy has said that, according to Ukraine’s commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, Kyiv’s forces “continued their activity on the territory of the Kursk region and are holding their positions”. In an X post on Saturday, he also said Ukrainian troops “have advanced and expanded our zone of control” in the Belgorod region. Putin announced the Easter ceasefire in the televised meeting with Gerasimov, saying Russian forces would stop combat operations from 6pm Moscow time on Saturday until midnight on Sunday. Russia’s president said he was ordering a temporary halt to the fighting out of “humanitarian considerations”. Zelenskyy posted on X soon after Putin’s announcement that Russian artillery fire was continuing on Saturday. “Russian artillery can still be heard in certain directions of the front, regardless of the Russian leader’s promise of silence. Russian drones are in use. In some areas, the situation has become quieter,” Zelenskyy said. According to the Ukrainian air force, Russia launched eight missiles and 87 drones in an overnight attack on Ukraine on Saturday, causing damage in five regions across the country. Air defence units shot down 33 Russian drones, and another 36 drones were redirected by electronic warfare, the air force said. It gave no details on missiles. Damage was recorded in five regions in the south, north-east and east, it said. Ukraine’s president put the onus on Russia to extend any ceasefire beyond the weekend. “Our actions are and will be symmetrical,” Zelenskyy said on X. “The proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day silence remains on the table – the answer to it must come from Moscow. Ukraine, together with our partners, is ready to move toward peace as constructively as possible, but same readiness is required from Russia.” Russian troops are “solidifying their presence” in the village of Kalynove in the Donetsk region, the Kyiv Independent reported, citing the DeepState military blog, which is considered close to Ukraine’s army. The publication reports, sourcing DeepState, that Russian forces are deploying infantry, and establishing logistical routes and communication lines in Kalynove. Australia will use “whatever avenues” it can to help Melbourne man Oscar Jenkins, who faces a 15-year jail term in Russia for fighting with Ukrainian troops. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said on Saturday that the government would “continue to make representations to the reprehensible regime of Vladimir Putin” to release Jenkins, 33, a former teacher who fought with Ukraine’s armed forces against Russia’s invasion."

But the main thing is that they do not deceive us in the details – neither us nor the US,” Ukraine’s president said in his nightly address. Despite the engagement, sanctions targeting Russian oil “are still expected to be implemented on Friday”, a senior Trump administration official said on Wednesday, according to Reuters. Separately, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said he did not want to exaggerate the progress made during Steve Witkoff’s talks with Putin. Many “impediments” remained, especially Russia’s territorial claims, and there was no concrete proposal for a ceasefire. There have been unconfirmed reports that the Kremlin could propose a halt to long-range strikes by both sides. Donald Trump could meet Vladimir Putin as soon as next week to discuss the war, White House officials have said, although senior administration officials warned that serious “impediments” remain to achieving a ceasefire. Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday: “There’s a good chance that there will be a meeting very soon.” He gave no indication where the meeting with Putin might take place. After sitting down with Putin, Trump then wants a three-way meeting with the Russian ruler and Zelenskyy, the New York Times and CNN reported, citing people familiar with the plan. The US president has proclaimed that “great progress was made” when Witkoff, a real estate dealer, met the Russian ruler at the Kremlin on Wednesday. Trump-Putin meetings about Ukraine have been raised as a possibility in the past but not eventuated. Trump has promised to introduce secondary tariffs on countries that import Russian oil if no progress is made towards a peace deal by Friday. On Wednesday, he issued an executive order imposing an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, citing India’s continuing imports of Russian oil. Russian artillery shelling killed three people and injured four on Wednesday in the south-eastern Ukrainian town of Nikopol, the regional governor said. Serhiy Lysak, governor of Dnipropetrovsk region, said two men and a woman died. Nikopol is on the Ukrainian-held north side of the Dnipro River. The RBK-Ukraine media outlet said the strike hit a car belonging to the state emergency services and one of those killed was an emergency worker. A US army soldier has been arrested for trying to provide classified information about America’s M1A2 Abrams main battle tank to Russia, the justice department said. Taylor Adam Lee, 22, of El Paso, Texas, is accused of seeking to “provide classified military information on US tank vulnerabilities to a person he believed to be a Russian intelligence officer in exchange for Russian citizenship”, said Roman Rozhavsky, assistant director of FBI counterintelligence. Lee handed over an SD card containing documents and information to an individual he believed to be a Russian agent, it is alleged. A majority of Ukrainians still trust Zelenskyy but their number fell to 58% of the population after an abortive move to curb the power of anti-corruption watchdogs led to protests, according to polling. The Kyiv International Institute of Sociology said on Wednesday that its poll, which began a day after the shock vote on 22 July, found trust was down from an 18-month high of 74% in May and 67% in February-March. Zelenskyy on Wednesday said he had visited troops near the frontline in the Sumy region. Ukraine on Wednesday appointed a new director of an economic crimes investigation unit. The prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said Oleksandr Tsyvinsky, a renowned anti-graft detective, would head the economic security bureau. The director is chosen by a panel including international experts and then confirmed by the government. The government had for weeks held back his appointment, citing family ties to Russia. Svyrydenko said Tsyvinsky took a polygraph test as part of the appointment process. Marta Kos, the EU’s enlargement commissioner, welcomed the appointment as a “crucial reform strongly encouraged by the EU”."

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov reiterated Russia’s demands on Sunday, including Ukraine withdrawing from Russia-annexed regions and abandoning its Nato aspirations – terms that Kyiv and its allies have rejected. “The main thing for us is to achieve our goals,” Peskov told state TV. “Our goals are clear.” Ukrainian officials proposed a new round of peace talks this week, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday, while Russian state media said on Sunday that no date had yet been set for the negotiations but Istanbul would probably remain the host city. A week ago Trump, the US president, threatened Russia with “severe tariffs” unless a peace deal was reached within 50 days and announced a rejuvenated pipeline for US weapons to reach Ukraine amid his frustration at unsuccessful talks to end the war. Russia launched a barrage of drones and missiles at Ukraine in an overnight attack on Monday, killing at least one person and causing multiple fires in Kyiv, city officials said. Rescuers and medics were working on sites across four districts of the capital, said its mayor, Vitali Klitschko. A subway station in central Kyiv as well as commercial property, shops, houses and a kindergarten were damaged, officials said. Explosions were heard across the city as air defence units engaged in repelling the attack and many Kyiv residents took shelter in underground stations. Russia’s biggest oil producer Rosneft has condemned European Union sanctions on India’s Nayara Energy refinery as unjustified and illegal, saying the restrictions directly threatened India’s energy security. The EU’s 18th package of sanctions against Russia over Ukraine was approved on Friday and is aimed at further hitting Russia’s oil and energy industry. Rosneft said on Sunday it held less than 50% in Nayara – one of the targeted companies – and called the EU’s justification for the sanctions “far-fetched and false in context”. The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, has said the sanctions package is one of the strongest yet against Russia and “we will keep raising the costs, so stopping the aggression becomes the only path forward for Moscow”. Two women were injured in southern Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region when a drone struck their house on Sunday, according to the regional military administration. Two more civilians were injured in the north-eastern Kharkiv province after a drone slammed into a residential building, local Ukrainian officials said. Drones struck a leafy square in the centre of Sumy later on Sunday, wounding a woman and her seven-year-old son, officials said. The strike also damaged a power line, leaving about 100 households without electricity, according to Serhii Krivosheienko of the municipal military administration. Ukraine’s air force said it shot down 18 of 57 Shahed-type and decoy drones launched by Russia overnight into Sunday, with seven more disappearing from radar. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces shot down 93 Ukrainian drones targeting Russian territory overnight, including at least 15 that appeared to head for Moscow. Ten more Ukrainian drones were downed on the approach to the Russian capital on Sunday, according to mayor Sergei Sobyanin. He said one drone struck a residential building in Zelenograd, on Moscow’s outskirts, damaging an apartment but causing no casualties."

Izhevsk, more than 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) from the frontline, has arms production facilities including factories that make attack drones and the world-famous Kalashnikov rifle. A Ukraine security services source said Kyiv had targeted an Izhevsk-based drone manufacturer and that the attack had disrupted Moscow’s “offensive potential”. Unverified videos posted on social media showed at least one drone buzzing over the city, while another showed a ball of flames erupt from the roof of a building, according to Reuters. The region’s head said the drones hit an industrial “enterprise”, without giving details. Both sides have raced to improve drone technology and enhance their use on the battlefield, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying on Monday that drone development was a “priority”. Russian President Vladimir Putin had a “substantial” phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on the Iran-Israel conflict and Ukraine, the Kremlin said on Tuesday, the first such exchange between the two leaders since September 2022. In Paris, Macron’s office said the call lasted two hours and that the French leader had called for a ceasefire in Ukraine and the start of negotiations on ending the conflict. A Kremlin statement said Putin “reminded [Macron] that the Ukrainian conflict is a direct consequence of the policy of western states”. A French diplomatic source said Macron had talked to Zelenskyy before and after his call with Putin to brief him on the talks. Macron also talked to US President Donald Trump about the exchange. The US is halting some shipments of weapons to Ukraine amid concerns that its own stockpiles have declined too much, officials said Tuesday. Certain munitions were previously promised to Ukraine under the Biden administration to aid its defences. The pause reflects a new set of priorities under President Donald Trump and came after defence department officials scrutinised current US stockpiles and raised concerns. “This decision was made to put America’s interests first following a review of our nation’s military support and assistance to other countries across the globe,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. “The strength of the United States Armed Forces remains unquestioned – just ask Iran.” Germany has pledged additional measures to further counter Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet” operating in the Baltic and North Sea, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday in a statement. Western sanctions aimed at cutting Russia’s oil revenues following its invasion of Ukraine have led to the rise of a vast “shadow fleet” of tankers that helps Moscow to keep its crude exports flowing. From Tuesday, German authorities have begun questioning passing tankers about their insurance coverage against oil pollution damage, the foreign ministry said, adding that the insurance coverage of “shadow fleet” vessels is often unknown, as they avoid reputable insurers and European ports. The UN’s nuclear watchdog IAEA said on Tuesday it has been informed of a drone attack last week near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that damaged several vehicles near the site’s cooling pond. The International Atomic Energy Agency said six drones had been involved in the incident and no injuries were reported. Ukraine’s top general ordered military officials on Tuesday to prohibit troop buildups in tent encampments and to build new shelters at training centres to protect soldiers against deadly Russian airstrikes. The order by Oleksandr Syrskyi comes after a spate of Russian attacks focused attention on lax discipline at military bases as Ukraine struggles to fend off a bigger and better-armed Russian military. Russian former deputy defence minister Timur Ivanov was found guilty of corruption and condemned to 13 years in a penal colony on Tuesday, the harshest sentence yet in a series of graft cases against defence officials. Ivanov was arrested in April 2024 on suspicion of taking bribes, and investigators added new embezzlement charges in October. More than a dozen people, including two other former deputy ministers, have been arrested in investigations into separate cases."

All of Ukraine was under air raid alerts in the early hours of Monday after the Ukrainian air force warned of Russian missile and drone attacks. Russia launched an air attack on Kyiv, which Ukraine’s air defence units were trying to repel, the military administration of the Ukrainian capital said on the Telegram messaging app early on Monday. Russia says its forces are advancing to the edge of the east-central Ukrainian region of Dnipropetrovsk for the first time in the three-year war, raising the prospect of a new front as the conflict escalates and peace talks stall. Russia is attacking the region after reaching the adjacent western frontier of Ukraine’s Donetsk region, according to Russia’s defence ministry. The pro-Ukrainian Deep State map showed forces very close to Dnipropetrovsk, which had a population of more than 3 million before the war, and advancing on the city of Kostyantynivka in Donetsk from several directions. A Ukrainian military spokesperson, Dmytro Zaporozhets, said that Russian forces were trying to “build a bridgehead for an attack” on Kostyantynivka, an important logistical hub for the Ukrainian army. Russian military units are also closing in on Sumy city, three years after Ukraine forced them out of the northern region. The troops appear to be within 18 miles (29km) of the city, which is 200 miles north-east of Kyiv. Independent monitors confirmed Kremlin claims to have retaken the village of Loknia, which had been liberated along with the rest of the Sumy region during Ukraine’s 2022 spring counteroffensive. Moscow and Kyiv are engaged in a public row over the return of the bodies of thousands of soldiers who have died in the war. Russia accused Ukraine of delaying the swap of prisoners of war and the return of the bodies of 12,000 dead soldiers. Ukraine denied those claims. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had not sent the names of more than 1,000 captured soldiers to be released. “In typical fashion, the Russian side is once again trying to turn even these matters into a dirty political and information game. For our part, we are doing everything we can to keep the exchange track moving forward,” he said in a video statement."

He added, without providing specifics, that Russia was moving its troops for new operations on Ukrainian soil. “There is no sign that the Russians have received signals to prepare for a postwar situation.” Separately, Zelenskyy said he had spoken to Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday, as he seeks to rally support for Ukraine beyond Europe. Both countries have taken cautious diplomatic positions on the Russian invasion. India is a major buyer of Russian oil and Saudi Arabia has pitched itself as a mediator in the conflict. Zelenskyy said he spoke to both leaders about strengthening Ukraine’s position in any peace process. “Communication with leaders is ongoing practically around the clock – we are in constant touch,” he wrote on X. “Now is the moment when there is a real chance to achieve peace.” Trump said he and Putin would discuss “land swapping” when they met on Friday and expressed frustration with Zelenskyy for putting conditions on such a potential agreement. During a news conference at the White House on Monday, the US president said he was frustrated with Zelenskyy’s insistence that Ukraine would need to hold a national referendum on any peace deal that stipulated recognising Russian control over territory that it has occupied during the war. “I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying I have to get constitutional approval,” Trump said. “He has approval to go to war and kill everybody but he needs approval to do a land swap. Because there will be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody.” Moscow hopes the Putin-Trump meeting will give momentum to the normalisation of relations between Russia and the US, the Tass news agency reported on Tuesday. “We hope that the upcoming high-level meeting will give an impulse to the normalization of bilateral relations,” Tass cited Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying. German chancellor Friedrich Merz on Monday invited Trump to join emergency virtual talks with EU leaders and Zelenskyy on Wednesday ahead of the Alaska summit. Merz’s office said in a statement that the virtual talks would focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” and “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security”. It is not clear whether or not Trump has accepted the invitation to the call. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Monday that the EU would work on a 19th package of sanctions against Russia and warned against concessions to Moscow. “As far as Russia has not agreed to full and unconditional ceasefire, we should not even discuss any concessions,” Kallas said in a statement. “The sequencing of the steps is important. First an unconditional ceasefire with a strong monitoring system and ironclad security guarantees,” she said, adding that “we will work on a 19th package of sanctions”. Ukraine has retaken two villages in its eastern region of Sumy, Kyiv’s military said, adding to recent small territorial gains along the border with Russia. Ukraine’s forces liberated the settlements of Stepne and Novokostiantynivka on the Sumy frontline, the general staff said on Tuesday. Monday’s gains followed Sunday’s news that Kyiv’s military had retaken the village of Bezsalivka. The battlefield reports could not be independently verified. The captain and two officers of a ship believed to belong to Russia’s so-called shadow fleet have been charged with sabotage for cutting five Baltic Sea cables in December, Finnish prosecutors said on Monday. The captain and first and second officers of the Cook Islands-registered oil tanker Eagle S are alleged to have dragged the ship’s anchor on the seabed for about 90km (56 miles), damaging five undersea cables in the Gulf of Finland. A Ukrainian drone attack killed one person and wounded two others in a region about 420km (260 miles) east of Moscow, a Russian official said on Monday. The governor of Nizhny Novgorod, Gleb Nikitin, said in a statement that drones targeted two “industrial zones” and caused the casualties and unspecified damage."

It said on Telegram it had hit four Su-34 aircraft at the Marinovka base outside the city of Volgograd, about 900km (550 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The post on Friday said the operation was conducted by the military’s special operations branch, together with the SBU security service and other services of the military. “According to preliminary information, four aircraft were hit, specifically SU-34 planes, as well as technical-operational facilities where different warplanes are serviced and repaired,” the statement said. There was no immediate comment from the Russian military. Ukraine’s military said the damage to Marinovka was being assessed and described the Su-34 as Russia’s main aircraft used in bombing raids on Ukrainian territory. Volgograd governor Andrei Bocharov on Friday listed the region’s Kalanchyovsky district where Marinovka is located among three areas targeted by Ukrainian drones and said traffic on the bridge over the Don River in the district was temporarily restricted. A Russian missile attack killed at least five people and wounded 25 in the industrial city of Samar in Ukraine’s south-east on Friday, officials said – the second strike on the city in three days. At least four of the wounded were in severe condition and taken to hospital, regional governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram. Officials gave no immediate details on damage in the city, where an attack on an infrastructure facility on Tuesday killed two people. Two people were killed and at least 14 wounded when a Russian drone smashed into a residential high-rise in Odesa, authorities said on Saturday. Three children were among the wounded in the overnight attack in the Ukrainian Black Sea city, with one in critical condition, regional governor Oleh Kiper said. Footage posted by the state emergency service showed firefighters battling a blaze and rushing residents down a dark stairwell in the 21-storey building. In the Kherson region to the east, authorities urged residents on Friday to prepare for extended periods without power after a Russian attack hit a key energy facility. Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said the attack caused power cuts in some settlements in the region, which is close to the front lines with Russian forces. Russia said its troops had captured the village of Nova Kruhlyakivka in Ukraine’s eastern Kharkiv region. The report on Friday from Russian state news agency Tass, citing the defence ministry, could not be independently verified. Russian president Vladimir Putin said Russia and Ukraine’s demands for peace were “absolutely contradictory”, after two rounds of talks have failed to bring a ceasefire. Russian and Ukrainian negotiators exchanged memorandums on how to end the war at talks in Istanbul this month and the Russian president said in Minsk on Friday: “As for the memorandums, as expected, nothing surprising happened ... these are two absolutely contradictory memorandums.” At the press conference in Minsk after a meeting with allies in Belarus, Putin also denounced what he called an “aggressive” pledge by Nato members to increase their defence spending to 5% of GDP. US president Donald Trump called Nato’s decision a “big win” for western civilisation. Putin also said on Friday that Russia was ready to hold a new round of peace talks with Ukraine, potentially in Istanbul, although the time and venue had yet to be agreed."

Russia has carried out “targeted strikes on such substations”, a ministry statement issued late on Friday said. “Deliberate strikes on civilian energy facilities that directly affect the safe operation of nuclear installations bear the hallmarks of nuclear terrorism and constitute a grave violation of international humanitarian law,” it added. The foreign ministry referred to a statement issued on Thursday by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, reporting military activity “that has led to damage to substations critical to nuclear safety and security in Ukraine”. The IAEA statement reported incidents near two nuclear plants – South Ukraine and Khmelnitskyi – that led to each plant losing access to an external power line. A third station at Rivne had been forced to reduce power at two of its four reactors, the IAEA statement adds. It gave no indication of which side might have been behind the incidents. Civilian life on the frontlines in Ukraine is becoming a battle for survival, with attacks on energy infrastructure threatening to spark a major winter crisis, the UN warned Friday. Matthias Schmale, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine, said civilians were increasingly bearing the brunt with the approach of the fourth winter since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. G7 energy ministers issued a joint statement on Friday to condemn Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy system, and said the group of countries will work to support Ukraine’s energy needs. “Russia’s recent attacks on Ukraine’s natural gas infrastructure have created risks to communities and human lives, weakening civilian infrastructure and the energy security of the Ukrainian people,” the ministers said. Ukraine landed special forces to fight in embattled parts of the eastern city of Pokrovsk earlier this week, just as Russia said it had surrounded Kyiv’s forces in the area, two Ukrainian military sources said on Friday. The operation shows how Ukraine is battling to stabilise the situation in the strategically important city after scores of Russian troops breached its perimeter this month. Russia’s capture of Pokrovsk, an important road and rail hub, could enable further advances into the eastern Donetsk region, which Russia aims to fully occupy. Moscow’s military has been inching forward towards Pokrovsk for over a year. Russian air defences downed three Ukrainian drones headed for Moscow, the city’s mayor said early on Saturday. Sergei Sobyanin, writing on Telegram, said specialists were examining fragments of the drones where they had fallen. Russia’s defence ministry had earlier reported that 38 Ukrainian drones had been intercepted and destroyed in a three-hour period over two regions in southern Russia and over Crimea. Flights were suspended for almost two hours at Berlin’s Brandenburg airport on Friday due to sightings of unidentified drones, the latest in a series of similar scares across Europe. Take-offs and landings were suspended between 8.08pm and 9.58pm and a “whole series of flights” were diverted to other German cities during the closure, an airport spokesman said. Airports in Denmark, Norway and Poland have also recently suspended flights due to unidentified drones, while Romania and Estonia have pointed the finger at Russia, which has brushed off the allegations. Germany has similarly pointed the finger at Moscow."

Explosions and a large fire were observed at the site, said the military. Ryazan is located about 200km (125 miles) south-east of Moscow. Russian officials often do not admit such attacks have succeeded, and the Ryazan governor, Pavel Malkov, adopted the standard line that Ukrainian drones were shot down but debris happened to hit the target. “Falling debris caused a fire on the premises of one enterprise,” Malkov said. A wave of 25 Ukrainian drones attacked the region, Malkov said. Officials in southern Ukraine said four people were killed by Russian attacks on Saturday. Prosecutors in the Kherson region said “three civilians are known to have been killed” in the village of Myklitskyi and the city of Kherson. The governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, Ivan Federov, said a Russian attack killed one person. The US will not lift sanctions on Serbian oil company NIS unless Belgrade terminates the firm’s majority Russian ownership, Serbia’s energy minister said on Saturday, warning that her country faced “difficult” decisions. Washington sanctioned Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS) as part of its crackdown on the Russian energy sector. Analysts say Serbia is on the brink of a winter energy crisis with its lone oil refinery facing a potential shutdown. Serbia’s energy minister, Dubravka Đedović Handanović, said the US wanted a “complete change of Russian shareholders” to be negotiated by 13 February before lifting sanctions. NIS is 45% owned by Gazprom Neft, which has been targeted by US sanctions. Neft’s parent company, Gazprom, has transferred its own 11.3% stake in NIS to another Russian firm, Intelligence. The Serbian state holds nearly 30% of NIS, with the rest owned by minority shareholders. Handanović suggested the Serbian government was looking at a possible Russian takeover of NIS and would hold a special cabinet meeting about it on Sunday. Ukraine has recorded a threefold increase in the number of attacks on its railway system since July, according to a senior minister, as Moscow seeks to scupper one of Kyiv’s key logistical systems, Peter Beaumont writes. The rail network carries more than 63% of the country’s freight – including grain shipments – and 37% of passenger traffic, according to the state statistics service. Military assistance from foreign countries often arrives by train. Oleksii Kuleba, a deputy prime minister, said: “What we have seen in these escalating attacks is that they are going after trains, especially trying to kill the drivers.” Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced an overhaul of state-owned energy companies amid a corruption scandal. Anti-graft investigators allege around $100m has been embezzled. Zelenskyy has already ordered two ministers to resign over the alleged scheme and sanctioned a former business partner who was named as its mastermind. “Alongside a full audit of their financial activities, the management of these companies is to be renewed,” Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian president called for a new supervisory board at Energoatom – the state nuclear company – “within a week” that would enable a “complete overhaul of the company’s management”. He also called for the quick appointment of a new head of hydropower generating company Ukrhydroenergo and other reforms for oil and gas giant Naftogaz and the main gas operator."

A joint statement from French, Italian, German, Polish, British and Finnish leaders and the president of the European commission welcomed the move but noted that the “path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine” and that negotiations could take place only in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities. It added: “only an approach that combines active diplomacy, support to Ukraine and pressure on the Russian Federation to end their illegal war can succeed”. They also said a resolution “must protect Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests”, including “the need for robust and credible security guarantees that enable Ukraine to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity”. US vice-president JD Vance met British foreign secretary David Lammy and representatives of Ukraine and European allies on Saturday at Chevening House, a country mansion south-east of London, to discuss Trump’s push for peace. A European official confirmed a counterproposal was put forward by European representatives at the Chevening meeting but declined to provide details. The Wall Street Journal said European officials had presented a counterproposal that included demands that a ceasefire must take place before any other steps are taken and that any territory exchange must be reciprocal, with firm security guarantees. “You can’t start a process by ceding territory in the middle of fighting,” it quoted one European negotiator as saying. The White House did not immediately respond when asked about the European counterproposals. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday rejected the idea that his country would give up land to end the war with Russia after Trump suggested a peace deal could include “some swapping of territories.” Zelenskyy said Ukraine “will not give Russia any awards for what it has done” and that “Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.” Later, Zelenskyy called the Chevening meeting constructive: “All our arguments were heard,” he said in his evening address to Ukrainians. “The path to peace for Ukraine should be determined together and only together with Ukraine, this is key principle.” French leader Emmanuel Macron stressed the need for Ukraine to play a role in any negotiations: “Ukraine’s future cannot be decided without the Ukrainians, who have been fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now,” he wrote on X after what he said were calls with Zelenskyy, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Starmer. “Europeans will also necessarily be part of the solution, as their own security is at stake.” On Saturday two people died and 16 were wounded when a Russian drone hit a minibus in the suburbs of the Ukrainian city of Kherson, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin said. Two others died after a Russian drone struck their car in the Zaporizhzhia region, according to regional governor Ivan Fedorov. Ukraine’s air force said it intercepted 16 of the 47 Russian drones launched overnight, while 31 drones hit targets across 15 different locations. It also said it shot down one of the two missiles Russia deployed. Russia’s defence ministry said its air defences shot down 97 Ukrainian drones over Russia and the Black Sea overnight and 21 more on Saturday morning."

The regional governor, Ivan Fedorov, said the attack on Zaporizhzhia cut power to 25,000 residents. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on X “Russians launched nearly 540 drones, 8 ballistic missiles, and 37 other types of missiles against civilian life”. He said 14 regions were targeted, including Kyiv and Chernivtsi in the south-west of the country bordering Romania. The Ukrainian air force said it had downed 510 of 537 drones and 38 of 45 missiles launched by Russia in the overnight attack. It recorded five missile and 24 drone hits at seven locations, according to its statement on Telegram. Russia confirmed it had launched the attacks, saying they were against “military” targets. The cities of Dnipro and Pavlograd in the central region of Dnipropetrovsk also came under attack early on Saturday, causing fires, the regional governor, Sergiy Lysak, wrote on Telegram, warning residents to take cover. Zelenskyy accused Moscow of using “the time meant for preparing a leaders-level meeting to organise new massive attacks” and called for “tougher” banking and energy sanctions on Russia. He said Russia’s latest attack had shown “its utter disregard for words”. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said she had asked the bloc’s governments to submit proposals next week for another package of sanctions against Russia after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Copenhagen. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said he expected that Russia would only stop its war against Ukraine once it could no longer wage it for economic and military reasons, given that diplomatic efforts in recent weeks had failed. “All efforts of the past weeks have been answered with an even more aggressive approach by this regime in Moscow against the population in Ukraine,” Merz said at a regional event in North Rhine-Westphalia on Saturday. “This will also not stop until we ensure together that Russia, at least for economic reasons, and perhaps also for military reasons can no longer continue this war.” The chief of Russia’s general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said on Saturday that Russian forces were waging non-stop offensives along the entire frontline in Ukraine and have the “strategic initiative”. Since March, Russia has captured more than 3,500 sq km of territory in Ukraine and taken control of 149 villages, Gerasimov added. “At present, the strategic initiative lies entirely with Russian forces,” he asserted. Russian troops have taken control of the village of Komyshuvakha in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, the Russian defence ministry said, adding that its forces had successfully carried out strikes with high-precision weapons on Ukrainian missile and aviation enterprises, as well as military airfields in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military said that it had struck Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran overnight. The military recorded multiple explosions and a fire at the Krasnodar oil refinery in Russia’s south and said there was also a fire in the Syzran oil refinery area in Samara region. Russian authorities in Krasnodar said falling drone debris damaged one of the refinery’s units. Twenty Ukrainian drones, including 18 over Russian-annexed Crimea, were shot down early on Saturday morning, the Russian defence ministry said. The other two drones were shot down over Russia’s western Smolensk region. Andriy Parubiy, a Ukrainian politician who previously served as the parliament speaker, was shot dead in western city of Lviv on Saturday. Prosecutors have opened a murder investigation and said police were still searching for the shooter but have not mentioned possible motives at this stage. Zelenskyy said the shooting was “carefully planned” and that “all necessary forces and means” would be used in the investigation. The foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, described Parubiy as “a patriot and statesman” who “rightfully belongs in the history books”, while the prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, called for a prompt investigation of the murder, calling it “a profound loss” for the country."

If confirmed, that would make Luhansk the first Ukrainian region to be fully occupied by Russia after more than three years of war. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv on Pasechnik’s claim. In remarks to Russia’s state TV Channel One that aired Monday evening, Pasechnik said he had received a report “literally two days ago” saying that “100%” of the region was now under the control of Russian forces. Russian forces have captured a village in the Ukrainian region of Dnipropetrovsk for the first time in their three-year offensive, Russian state media and pro-war bloggers have claimed. Dnipropetrovsk, which lies to the west of the Donetsk region, is not among the five Ukrainian regions over which Russia has asserted a formal territorial claim. There was no immediate confirmation from Ukrainian officials or from the Russian defence ministry. North Korea’s state media showed on Monday leader Kim Jong-un draping coffins with the national flag in what appeared to be the repatriation of soldiers killed fighting for Russia against Ukraine, as the countries marked a landmark military treaty. In a series of photographs displayed in the backdrop of a gala performance by North Korean and visiting Russian artists in Pyongyang, Kim is seen by rows of a half a dozen coffins, covering them with flags and pausing briefly with both hands resting on them. The European Union said Monday it had agreed a new long-term trade deal with Ukraine, covering imports of food products from the war-torn country that have angered EU farmers. Brussels and Kyiv have been wrangling over the deal after protests from farmers saw the EU slap quotas on tariff-free Ukrainian agricultural imports into the bloc. Brussels added certain restrictions in 2024, when it extended the agreement for one additional year, by introducing a maximum ceiling on certain tariff-free products such as cereals, poultry, eggs, sugar and corn. The European Commission said that under the new deal – which still needs to be finalised – quotas would remain for those sensitive agricultural areas. In return, Kyiv will cut its quotas for pork, poultry and sugar imported from the EU and push to align its food production standards with those of the 27-nation bloc by 2028, Brussels said. The International Monetary Fund said on Monday it has completed its eighth review of Ukraine’s $15.5bn four-year support program, paving the way for a disbursement of an additional $500m to the war-torn country. That will bring total disbursements to $10.6bn, the IMF said in a statement, after its board’s approval of the review of Ukraine’s Extended Fund Facility. It warned of ongoing and “exceptionally high” risks to the country’s outlook. Russian President Vladimir Putin “wants to subjugate the whole of Ukraine and at the same time spread fear throughout Europe,” German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on a visit to Kyiv on Monday, adding that Putin’s “alleged willingness to negotiate is just a facade.” Kyiv and its allies have accused Russia of sabotaging diplomatic efforts, which have stalled in recent weeks, despite Washington’s desires to reach a quick peace deal. US President Donald Trump’s senior envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellog also said on Monday that Russia cannot continue to stall for time “while it bombs civilian targets in Ukraine.” “We urge an immediate ceasefire and a move to trilateral talks to end the war,” Kellogg wrote on X."

Peace hopes dimmed on Friday when Russia ruled out any immediate meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents but Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the “format of talks between leaders is the most effective way forward”, renewing calls for a bilateral summit, as sought by US president Donald Trump. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov earlier criticised Zelenskyy for “demanding an immediate meeting at all costs” but the Ukrainian president, speaking at a ceremony attended by western officials including US envoy Keith Kellogg, vowed “to push Russia to peace”. US vice-president JD Vance claimed Putin had made “significant concessions” towards a negotiated settlement, expressing confidence that progress was being made despite the lack of clear signs. Vance told NBC the Russian concessions included that Ukraine would receive security guarantees protecting against future Russian aggression. “They’ve recognised that they’re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv,” he said. “That was, of course, a major demand at the beginning. And importantly, they’ve acknowledged that there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.” Canadian prime minister Mark Carney has told Zelenskyy he backs Ukraine’s calls for robust security guarantees as part of any peace deal, saying Canada would not rule out sending troops under such a framework. Carney backed Ukraine’s calls for potential international participation, telling a joint press conference in Kyiv on Sunday: “In Canada’s judgment, it is not realistic that the only security guarantee could be the strength of the Ukrainian armed forces ... that needs to be buttressed and reinforced.” The two leaders also signed an agreement on drone co-production. Zelenskyy was asked at the press conference about a Wall Street Journal report that said the Pentagon had for months been quietly blocking Ukraine’s use of the US-supplied Atacms missiles to hit targets deep inside in Russia. In response he said Kyiv had of late been using its own domestically produced long-range weapons to hit targets inside Russia, which are not cleared with Washington. “Lately we have not been discussing this issue with the United States.” Russia said on Sunday that its forces had captured a new settlement in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region but Ukraine’s top commander said Kyiv’s troops had made gains elsewhere, recapturing three villages in eastern Donetsk region. The Russian defence ministry said it had taken Filia village in Dnipropetrovsk, while Ukraine made no acknowledgement that Filia had changed hands. Moscow says it has been making inroads into Dnipropetrovsk while Ukrainian forces have been pressing to recapture villages in the Donetsk region – the focal point of the Russian advance – and to prevent any further movement into Dnipropetrovsk. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine’s top commander, said on Telegram that Kyiv’s forces had retaken the Donetsk villages of Mykhailivka, Zelenyi Hai and Volodymyrivka. The battlefield reports could not be independently verified. Moscow has accused Kyiv of launching dozens of drone attacks – including one that sparked a fire at a nuclear power plant – as Ukrainians marked independence day, reports Angelique Chrisafis. The drone attack on the Kursk plant in western Russia, 37 miles (60km) from the Ukraine border, caused damage to an auxiliary transformer and forced a 50% reduction in the operating capacity of a reactor, Russian authorities said. Ukraine did not immediately comment on the alleged attack. The fire sparked by the drone, which was shot down, had been extinguished and there were no casualties or increased radiation levels, the plant said on Sunday. Ukraine and Russia said on Sunday they had each sent back 146 prisoners of war and civilians in the latest of a series of swaps. Press freedom group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) welcomed the release of two Ukrainian journalists, Dmytro Khyliuk and Mark Kaliush, denouncing “their abductions and the abuse they suffered in detention”. A Russian artillery strike killed a woman and wounded two residents in the town of Kupiansk in Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region. In the eastern region of Dnipropetrovsk, a Russian drone strike killed a woman, the governor said."

Kyiv is raising the number of its assault troops in the area, the 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Facebook, adding that the situation remained “difficult and dynamic”. Capturing Pokrovsk, dubbed “the gateway to Donetsk”, would be the most important Russian territorial gain inside Ukraine since Moscow took the ruined city of Avdiivka in early 2024. Russian troops thwarted an attempt by Ukrainian special forces to fly soldiers in via a helicopter into Pokrovsk, Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday. All 11 Ukrainians aboard the helicopter were killed, the ministry said. Two Ukrainian military sources said on Saturday that Kyiv had landed special forces to fight in parts of Pokrovsk, as Moscow said its troops had surrounded Ukrainian contingents. Data shows Russia fired more missiles at Ukraine in overnight attacks during October than in any month since at least the start of 2023. Russia’s army fired 270 missiles over October, up 46% on the previous month, according to an AFP analysis of daily data published by Ukraine’s air force. The strikes, which have targeted Ukraine’s fragile energy grid for the fourth winter running, have cut power to hundreds of thousands of people. It is part of what Kyiv and its backers say is a deliberate and cynical strategy to wear down Ukraine’s civilian population – a charge Russia denies. A Russian strike set ablaze a shop in Ukraine’s southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region on Saturday, killing two people and injuring several others, the region’s acting governor said. Vladislav Haivanenko, writing on Telegram, said the shop was destroyed and seven dwellings were damaged in the attack in Samarivskyi district – just outside the region’s main city, Dnipro. Public broadcaster Suspilne said seven people were injured. Pictures posted online showed a large blaze amid piles of rubble. Ukraine’s emergency services said one person had been killed in an attack on the town of Marhanets, further south in Dnipropetrovsk region. A Ukrainian drone attack damaged and set ablaze a tanker and infrastructure at a major oil terminal in Russia’s key Black Sea port of Tuapse overnight, authorities in the southern region of Krasnodar said on Sunday. “A fire broke out on the vessel. The crew were evacuated,” the administration said on the Telegram messaging app. The port is home to the Tuapse Black Sea oil terminal and a Rosneft-controlled oil refinery, which Ukraine has targeted with several drone strikes this year. It was not immediately known if the terminal was operating after the attack. Russian energy company Gazprom’s average daily natural gas supplies to Europe via the TurkStream undersea pipeline rose 5% in October from the previous months, Reuters calculations showed on Saturday. Turkey is the only transit route left for Russian gas to Europe after Ukraine chose not to extend a five-year transit deal with Moscow when it expired on 1 January. Germany’s defence minister is confident its fractious ruling coalition can agree on a new model of military service in time for it to come into effect next year as planned, given security concerns over Russia, he told news agency Reuters on Saturday. The cabinet has already agreed to minister Boris Pistorius’ proposal for a new voluntary military service to help boost the number of recruits and reservists. The plan still requires approval by German parliament."

He said he was unhappy about Russia’s strike on an American factory in Ukraine this week, which caused a fire that injured some of the facility’s employees. At the same White House event where he mentioned possible sanctions, he showed a photograph of his meeting with Putin on the red carpet in Alaska, saying Putin wanted to attend the World Cup 2026 football tournament in the US. “I’m going to sign this for him. But I was sent one, and I thought you would like to see it, it’s a man named Vladimir Putin, who I believe will be coming, depending on what happens. He may be coming, and he may not, depending on what happens,” Trump said. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile said Russia was doing everything it could to prevent a meeting between him and Putin. Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for Putin to meet him, saying it is the only way to negotiate an end to the war. He accused Russia of stalling. “The meeting is one of the components of how to end the war,” he said on Friday at a press conference in Kyiv with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte. “And since they don’t want to end it, they will look for space to [avoid it].” Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, told NBC there was no agenda for such a summit. “Putin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy when the agenda would be ready for a summit. And this agenda is not ready at all,” he said. During a visit to a nuclear research centre on Friday, Putin said Trump’s leadership qualities would help restore US-Russia relations. “With the arrival of President Trump, I think that a light at the end of the tunnel has finally loomed. And now we had a very good, meaningful and frank meeting in Alaska,” Putin said. Ukraine has attacked a key pumping station on the Druzhba oil pipeline bringing fuel to Europe from Russia, Deborah Cole reports. The attack knocked out supplies to Hungary and Slovakia, the only remaining EU member states still receiving Russian oil. The Hungarian and Slovakian governments wrote to the European Commission after the attack, saying that Russian oil supplies could be suspended for at least five days owing to the damage. “The physical and geographical reality is that without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries is simply not possible,” their foreign ministers, Péter Szijjártó and Juraj Blanár, said in a letter. The Russian warlord and businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin looked “doomed” after his failed mutiny and told his mother he expected to die in the days before his private plane crash, Pjotr Sauer reports. Prigozhin, the founder of the notorious Wagner mercenary group, died when his business jet went down in the summer of 2023, two months after his fighters briefly seized control of the southern city of Rostov-on-Don and advanced towards Moscow in a short-lived rebellion against Russia’s military leadership. “When I last saw him, he looked doomed,” said Violetta Prigozhina, 85, in an interview with the Russian outlet Fontanka."

Ukraine should abandon any notion of restoring its borders established with the 1991 collapse of Soviet rule or even those dating from the 2022 full-scale Russian invasion, the country’s former military commander was quoted as saying on Thursday. Valerii Zaluzhnyi, now Ukraine’s ambassador to London, was replaced as top commander in February 2024 after months of reported disagreements between him and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “I hope that there are not people in this room who still hope for some kind of miracle or lucky sign that will bring peace to Ukraine, the borders of 1991 or 2022 and that there will be great happiness afterward,” the RBK Ukraine news site quoted Zaluzhnyi as telling a forum in Kyiv. “My personal opinion is that the enemy still has resources, forces and means to launch strikes on our territory and attempt specific offensive operations.” Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned on Thursday that Russia threatened security in Europe as he visited Lithuania to mark the official formation of Germany’s first permanent overseas military unit since the second world war, aimed at bolstering Nato’s eastern flank. The decision to build up a 5,000-strong armoured brigade in Lithuania over the coming years came in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “There is a threat to us all from Russia,” Merz told reporters in Vilnius. Russia has appointed a key commander of the gruelling siege of Mariupol, Gen Andrey Mordvichev, as head of the ground forces, the official newspaper of the Russian army reported on Thursday. Defence minister Andrey Belousov described the 49-year-old general as “an experienced combat officer who fully demonstrated his talent as a military commander during the special military operation,” using Moscow’s term for its Ukraine offensive, according to the Red Star newspaper. Russia said it had shot down 159 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions, including about 20 headed towards Moscow, between 8 am and 8 pm on Thursday. The previous day, Russia said it shot down well over 300 Ukrainian drones. Three Moscow airports – Domodedovo, Vnukovo and Zhukovsky – suspended flights intermittently. The EU on Thursday ordered temporary measures for Ukrainian farm imports after failing to agree on a new long-term accord with the Ukrainian government. The EU gave tariff-free access to most Ukrainian agricultural imports after Russia’s 2022 invasion to help the Ukrainian economy. But European farmers say the Ukrainian produce unfairly undercuts their own. The initial agreement with Ukraine is set to expire on 5 June, and both sides appear unable to reach an agreement before the deadline. EU lawmakers meanwhile approved tariffs on fertiliser imports from Russia on Thursday, despite European farmers’ fears the move could send prices soaring. The European parliament voted 411-100 for a bill that will enact duties in July and gradually increase them to a point where they would make imports unviable. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the move showed that the Europeans “continue, as always, to shoot themselves in the foot”."

Russian forces have slowly gained ground in costly battles for largely devastated areas in eastern and southern Ukraine, normally with few inhabitants or intact buildings left. Separately, Ukraine’s military general staff rejected Moscow’s claims to have fully captured the villages of Zaporizke and Novogeorgiivka just inside Dnipropetrovsk oblast. But battlefield monitor DeepState, which has close ties to Ukraine’s military, said on Tuesday that Russia had “occupied” them and was “consolidating its positions [and] accumulating infantry for a further advance”. Dnipropetrovsk is not one of the five Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Crimea – that Moscow has illegally annexed as Russian territory. Ukrainian men aged 18 to 22 are now allowed to cross the border freely in either direction under martial law, the prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, has announced. “This applies to all citizens in this age group. The decision also concerns citizens who, for various reasons, are located outside Ukraine,” said Svyrydenko. “We want Ukrainians to maintain a maximum of links with Ukraine.” Previous regulations introduced after Russia’s February 2022 invasion barred men aged 18-60 from leaving the country. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had met with military leadership about the situation at the frontline and in the border areas. “We discussed in detail the key needs of each direction and units. It is very important that the nature of the situation in the border areas of Sumy and Kharkiv regions is determined by our units.” Ukraine’s president added: “Of course, we pay due attention to the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions. We discussed the needs for additional supplies for these directions. The commander-in-chief reported on the implementation of the headquarters’ decisions on providing reserves for the defence forces.” Zelenskyy said contact was being made with Turkey, the Gulf states and European countries about hosting talks if Vladimir Putin ended up agreeing. “From our side, things will be prepared to the maximum in order to end the war,” said the Ukrainian president. Ukrainian top presidential aide Andriy Yermak and national security council chief Rustem Umerov were in Doha on Tuesday meeting with the Qataris. Zelenskyy added: “Russia is only giving signals that it is going to continue to avoid real negotiations. This can only be changed by strong sanctions, strong tariffs – real pressure.” The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, said he hoped Donald Trump’s patience with Putin would run out soon. Stubb said he had warned Trump that Putin was deploying a “typical” Russian delaying tactic to avoid meeting Zelenskyy. Finland and other European countries “will do everything we can do achieve lasting peace”, Stubb said. On security guarantees for Ukraine, Zelenskyy said their “defence component … should be detailed in the near future”. In Brussels on Tuesday, the EU foreign affairs spokesperson Anitta Hipper said the EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, had overnight been on a call with Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and several European foreign ministers. European Commission spokesperson Paula Pinho said there should soon be a report from national security advisers on what would be put forward for Ukraine’s security. A combat drone, presumed to be Ukrainian, went off course and exploded over Estonia without causing any casualties, the Baltic state and close Ukraine ally said on Tuesday, AFP reported. Pieces were found by an agricultural worker near the south-eastern town of Tartu, 75km (45 miles) from the border with Russia. Margo Palloson, director general of Estonia’s Internal Security Service (ISS), said it was believed the drone was aimed at Russia but “diverted from its trajectory by Russian GPS jamming and other electronic warfare means, causing it to enter Estonian airspace”."
world/2025/aug/08/donald-tusk-freeze-ukraine-war-close-us-russia-plan-talks,"‘Freeze’ in Ukraine war may be close, says Tusk, as US and Russia plan talks",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/08/donald-tusk-freeze-ukraine-war-close-us-russia-plan-talks,"‘Freeze’ in Ukraine war may be close, says Tusk, as US and Russia plan talks","A “freeze” in the war in Ukraine may be close, the Polish prime minister said on Friday, as the White House and the Kremlin push forward with discussions for a high-level summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in the coming days. Donald Tusk’s remarks came after he spoke with the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has communicated with Trump and European leaders in recent days as the White House continues to try to broker an end to the three-and-a-half-year war. “There are certain signals, and we also have an intuition, that perhaps a freeze in the conflict – I don’t want to say the end, but a freeze in the conflict – is closer than it is further away,” Tusk said during a news conference. “There are hopes for this.” Tusk said Zelenskyy was “very cautious but optimistic” about the ceasefire, Reuters reported. Ukraine was keen that Poland and other European countries play a role in planning for a ceasefire and an eventual peace settlement, Tusk said. Trump has said he is willing to meet Putin one on one without preconditions, including direct negotiations between Putin and Zelenskyy, stoking fears that Ukraine may be left out of negotiations for the framework of a potential ceasefire. Bloomberg reported on Friday that the deal could cement some of Putin’s territorial gains in Ukraine, effectively freezing the battle lines in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Putin has claimed four Ukrainian regions in their entirety, although much of their territory remains under Ukrainian control. US and Russian officials were working on a deal under which Russia would halt its offensive in exchange for the territorial concessions – making it a politically fraught proposal in Ukraine, Bloomberg said. Zelenskyy has responded by speaking with European leaders including the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who are key conduits to Trump. Fox News reported on Friday that the meeting could take place at the end of next week. Potential venues include Switzerland, Rome, Hungary and the United Arab Emirates, the conservative outlet said. Switzerland and Italy are parties to the international criminal court (ICC), which has issued an arrest warrant for Putin, and their law enforcement would theoretically be required to detain the Russian president. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán announced plans to withdraw from the ICC earlier this year. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said Putin did not have to meet Zelenskyy first before the US and Russian presidents could meet. “No, he doesn’t,” Trump said. “They would like to meet with me and I’ll do whatever I can to stop the killing.” Putin said he was not ready to meet Zelenskyy, even as the Kremlin claimed preparations were under way for a bilateral summit with Trump next week. “I have nothing against it in general, it is possible, but certain conditions must be created for this,” Putin said of a meeting with Zelenskyy. “But unfortunately, we are still far from creating such conditions.” The US envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed a three-way meeting with Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy but the Kremlin had ignored that suggestion, said the Putin aide Yuri Ushakov, and was “focusing on preparations for a bilateral meeting with Trump in the first place”. No venue has been set for the potential summit but Putin did mention that Dubai in the UAE was a possibility during a meeting with its leader, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. In the past 48 hours, White House officials have offered conflicting statements about whether Trump would agree to meet Putin. Witkoff, a close friend of Trump’s, is seen as a strong proponent of the meeting and had proposed it to Putin this week, while the national security adviser and secretary of state, Marco Rubio, later said that “a lot has to happen before [a summit] can occur”. The wide gamut of foreign policy views in the administration, which includes JD Vance’s scepticism of Ukraine and belief that the US should turn its focus away from Europe toward more pressing threats such as China, has helped its approach appear haphazard, while Trump’s Oval Office comments suggest that the administration is still interested in holding a summit. Last month, Trump issued an ultimatum for Putin to agree to a ceasefire or face secondary sanctions with the deadline set for this Friday. That deadline appeared in place despite plans for the summit, although the White House has not said what secondary measures it could enforce. Trump did target India with a 25% tariff hike for purchasing Russian oil this week, singling out one of Moscow’s economic enablers in a move that New Delhi complained was unfair and selective. Trump had grown frustrated with Putin in public in recent months as the war dragged through its third year and Putin continued to launch nightly missile and drone strikes on Ukrainian cities despite Trump’s insistence that he could strike a deal within 24 hours of becoming president. “Putin … talks nice and then he bombs everybody in the evening,” Trump said last month. “So there’s a little bit of a problem there.” Asked on Thursday whether the deadline still applied, Trump said: “It’s gonna be up to him. We’re going to see what he has to say. It’s gonna be up to him. Very disappointed.” Trump last week also announced that he would reposition nuclear submarines in response to a social media post by Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev, who said that Trump was “playing the ultimatum game with Russia” and had taken a “step toward war”."

The Ukrainian president said on Tuesday: “I asked the Security Service of Ukraine to transfer information of a broader nature to the Chinese side regarding Chinese citizens who work at the drone factory. We believe that it may be that Russia stole – made an agreement with these citizens outside the agreements with the Chinese leadership – stole these technologies.” Beijing’s ambassador, Ma Shengkun, was summoned over the allegations, as well as evidence of Chinese citizens fighting in the Russian army. “[Ukrainian] deputy foreign minister Yevhen Perebyinis stressed that the participation of Chinese citizens in hostilities against Ukraine on the side of the aggressor state, as well as the involvement of Chinese companies in the production of military products in Russia, are of serious concern and contradict the spirit of partnership between Ukraine and China,” said a Ukrainian statement on Tuesday. Perebyinis “called on the Chinese side to take measures to stop supporting Russia in its aggression against Ukraine, the absence of which has been repeatedly stated by Beijing”. Beijing had not responded to the latest claims at time of writing. Zelenskyy said on Thursday of last week that Ukrainian intelligence showed China was supplying weapons to Russia, including gunpowder and artillery, and that Chinese representatives were involved in weapons production on Russian territory. China dismissed this as groundless, but Tuesday’s statements by Zelenskyy made good on a promise to provide details this week. Two alleged Chinese soldiers have been caught by Ukraine and shown to the press, and Zelenskyy has said there at least 155 Chinese nationals operating on Russia’s side. The Chinese government has consistently denied providing military support to Russia or taking its side in the war. A Russian drone attack killed at least seven people and injured six others in the city of Marhanets in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, the regional governor said on Wednesday morning. Overnight into Wednesday there were drone attacks across east, south and central Ukraine. “A massive Russian drone attack on Poltava: three people injured,” Ukraine’s emergency service posted, referring to the central Ukrainian region. Fires broke out and residential buildings, enterprises, warehouses, and garages were damaged, the service said. Two people were injured when civilian infrastructure was hit in the suburbs of the Black Sea port city of Odesa, said Oleh Kiper, the regional governor. Large fires resulted from a Russian drone attack on the city of Kharkiv, said its mayor, Ihor Terekhov. Air defence units also opened fire in the Kyiv region. In Russia, Dmitry Milyaev, governor of the Tula region which borders the Moscow region, said air defence units destroyed several Ukrainian drones. Russia earlier hit a residential area in the eastern Ukrainian city of Myrnograd with drones on Tuesday, killing three people and wounding two, authorities said. One person was reported dead and 23 wounded after two bombs hit the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, the region’s governor said. Russian strikes wounded another six people in the southern city of Kherson and seven in Kharkiv in the north-east, officials said. Representatives from Ukraine, the UK, France and the US will meet in London on Wednesday to continue talks on a potential ceasefire. Media reports have suggested the US is promoting a “peace deal” that heavily favours Russia. Donald Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Gen Keith Kellogg, will attend the discussions, according to a US state department spokesperson, Tammy Bruce. Contrary to a previous announcement, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, will not be attending. Even though he is the administration’s Ukraine envoy, Kellogg has been largely sidelined from the publicised peace talks that the US has been holding separately with Russia and Ukraine. David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, will host the US and European negotiators in London. On Wednesday there was speculation that Russia has told Washington it might be willing to drop its claim to parts of Ukraine it does not occupy, write Dan Harding and Luke Sabbagh, giving rise to a ceasefire along roughly the existing frontlines. Russia has been demanding that Ukraine hand over the entirety of four eastern and southern regions its forces only partly occupy."

Kyiv has prepared a list of about $90bn worth of American weapons that it wants to buy, with Ukrainian officials set to visit the US this month or next for talks. Ukraine’s president said he had shared with US president Donald Trump “a certain vision of what could be done” to respond to Russia’s actions. “In addition to the large arms deal, which we call the ‘mega deal’, we also discussed the ‘drone deal’. Technical groups are already starting to work on this deal,” Zelenskyy told reporters on Saturday. “It concerns drones that the United States will purchase directly from Ukraine.” Zelenskyy announced on Saturday that Israel had for the first time supplied Ukraine with a US-made Patriot anti-missile defence system. “The Israeli [Patriot] system is operating in Ukraine. It has been operating for a month. We will receive two Patriot systems in the fall,” Zelenskyy told reporters. Kyiv came under heavy bombardment early on Sunday in what independent monitors said was one of the biggest Russian attacks on the Ukrainian capital since Moscow launched its full-scale war more than three and a half years ago. Drones flew over the city and surrounding region and anti-aircraft fire rang out through the night. Some residents fled to metro stations deep underground for safety. Many regions across the country were under air raid alert. Poland closed the airspace near its south-eastern cities of Lublin and Rzeszow and the Polish military said it scrambled aircraft to ensure the security of its airspace after Russia launched strikes on Ukraine. “In connection with the activity of the Russian Federation’s long-range aviation carrying out strikes on the territory of Ukraine, Polish and allied aircraft have begun operating in our airspace,” the military said in a post on X. It described the actions as preventive and aimed at securing airspace and protecting citizens. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has warned that any aggression against Moscow will be met with a “decisive response”, warning against attempts to down aircraft in Russian airspace. “Russia is being accused of almost planning to attack the North Atlantic alliance and the European Union countries,” Lavrov told the UN general assembly. “Russia has never had and does not have any such intentions. However, any aggression against my country will be met with a decisive response.” Speaking later to reporters, Lavrov said that if any country downs objects still within Russian airspace, “they will very much regret it”. Lavrov went out of his way still to praise Trump, who despite his public musings on Putin has yet to impose long-threatened new economic sanctions on Russia. “In the approaches of the current US administration, we see a desire not only to contribute to ways to realistically resolve the Ukrainian crisis, but also a desire to develop pragmatic cooperation without adopting an ideological stance,” Lavrov said. The power cut to the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s biggest, has continued for a fourth day, Ukraine said on Saturday, accusing Moscow of causing the blackout. “As a result of Russian actions, the Zaporizhzhia NPP (Nuclear Power Plant) has been without power for the fourth day,” the foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga, said on X, adding “we urge all nations concerned about nuclear safety and security to make it clear to Moscow that its nuclear gamble must end”. Emergency generators are being used to power cooling and safety systems after the final power line into the plant was cut on the Russian side at 4.56pm on Tuesday. Russia on Saturday claimed to have captured three villages in eastern Ukraine. Moscow has captured about 0.8% of Ukraine’s total land area since the beginning of the year, according to Russia’s defence ministry. The villages of Derylove and Maiske were seized in the Donetsk region, the Russian army said in a statement, while the settlement of Stepove was taken in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Ukraine said an overnight Russian barrage killed one person and wounded 12 in the south-eastern Kherson region, and damaged railways in the neighbouring Odesa region. Russia said an oil pumping station in the Chuvashia republic suspended operation after a Ukrainian drone strike deep behind the front line."

Moscow’s forces captured the villages of Sredneye and Kleban-Byk along the 1,000km (620 mile) frontline in Donetsk, the Russian defence ministry said on Telegram on Saturday. The taking of Kleban-Byk would mark a further advance towards Kostiantynivka – a key fortified town on the road to Kramatorsk, the location of a major Ukrainian logistics base. Russia said on Friday its troops had captured three villages in Donetsk. Ukraine’s military did not acknowledge that any of the villages had changed hands. On Saturday, Ukrainian military officials said on Telegram its forces had stopped a Russian advance and recaptured the village of Zeleny Gai in Donetsk. The village was being subjected to new Russian attacks, a military statement said. The battlefield reports could not be independently verified. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa added his voice to calls for a Russia-Ukraine summit during a phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “President Ramaphosa stressed the urgency of holding bilateral and trilateral meetings between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine and the United States as key to signal a firm commitment to ending the war,” a statement from Ramaphosa’s office said on Saturday. Zelenskyy said he told Ramaphosa he was ready for any kind of meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin. “However, we see that Moscow is once again trying to drag everything out even further,” he posted on X. Ramaphosa spoke last Monday with Putin, whom he has called a “dear ally”. The Pentagon has been blocking Ukraine from using US-made long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia, limiting Kyiv’s ability to employ the weapons in its defence, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing US officials. The report could not immediately be verified. As the White House has sought to persuade Putin to meet Zelenskyy for peace talks, an approval process put in place at the Pentagon has kept Ukraine from using the army tactical missile systems (Atacms) to launch strikes deep into Russian territory, the WSJ reported on Saturday. Russian air defences downed a drone headed for Moscow on Saturday and specialists were examining fragments on the ground, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Telegram. Several airports in central Russia suspended operations because of concerns over safe airspace, Russia’s air transport agency said. Officials at the airport in St Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city, were quoted by Russian news agencies as saying dozens of flights had been delayed. France has summoned the Italian ambassador after Italian deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini challenged French president Emmanuel Macron for suggesting European soldiers be deployed in Ukraine in a postwar settlement, Reuters reported a French diplomatic source as saying on Saturday. Asked during the week to comment on Macron’s appeals to deploy European soldiers in Ukraine after any such deal with Russia, Salvini used a Milanese dialect phrase loosely translatable as “get lost”. “You go there if you want. Put your helmet on, your jacket, your rifle and you go to Ukraine,” he told reporters, referring to Macron. The family of a British aid volunteer reportedly killed in a drone strike in Ukraine have said they are “very disappointed” by the response from authorities. Annie Lewis Marffy, 69, travelled from her home in Silverton in Devon, south-west England, in May to deliver a vehicle packed with supplies in a mission arranged by the non-profit Aid Ukraine UK. She was reportedly fatally injured in a Russian drone strike on 11 June, according to a police file, while Kramatorsk district police department said her body remained in an area of hostilities and could not be evacuated. Lewis Marffy’s relatives have asked for a death certificate to be issued for the “brave, capable and determined” mother-of-three. “All the family, the sisters and the sons, have been very disappointed at the reaction of the FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office] and the lack of response from the police,” the relatives said, adding: “The family are desperate to get more information.” Ukrainian flags will appear above Downing Street and several Whitehall buildings to mark 34 years since Ukraine left the Soviet Union, the British government said. The prime minister’s official residence at No 10 Downing Street is among the buildings where a flag will fly on Sunday. A government spokesperson said: “We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people, including those who have made a second home here in the UK, in the face of continued Russian aggression.”"
world/2025/jun/20/ukraine-war-briefing-russia-on-verge-of-recession-putin-minister-tells-economic-showcase,"Ukraine war briefing: Russia ‘on verge of recession’, Putin minister tells economic showcase",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/20/ukraine-war-briefing-russia-on-verge-of-recession-putin-minister-tells-economic-showcase,"Ukraine war briefing: Russia ‘on verge of recession’, Putin minister tells economic showcase","Vladimir Putin’s economy minister has warned that Russia is “on the verge” of recession as he spoke on the second day of a signature event meant to bolster economic confidence. The minister, Maxim Reshetnikov, said at the St Petersburg economic forum that his view was based on “current business sentiment and indicators” pointing to a slowdown. “Everything else depends on our decisions,” Reshetnikov said, calling for the central bank to show a “little love for the economy”. Russia’s central bank raised interest rates to an eye-watering 21% in October 2024 to combat inflation and kept them at that level until this month when it eased them to 20%. Russia’s economic growth slowed to 1.4% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2025, the lowest quarterly figure in two years. Prices are rising across the economy driven up by massive government spending on the war and widespread labour shortages. Annual inflation has been more than double the central bank’s 4% target for over a year. Economists have warned since the war began that any Russian growth driven by the defence industry is unsustainable and does not reflect a real increase in productivity. Kharkiv and Odesa were under attack from Russian-launched drones in the early hours of Friday, according to local officials and social media channels. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant “cannot start operating again as long as this large-scale war continues”, the UN nuclear agency has said. The plant, illegally held by the Russians, has too many issues with cooling water and its need for electricity supplied from offsite, the IAEA said. Russia and Ukraine said on Thursday that they had completed another exchange of captured soldiers. Neither side said how many. “Our people are returning home from Russian captivity,” said Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president. The Ukrainian government agency overseeing the exchanges said it involved “seriously ill and wounded” soldiers. Russia’s defence ministry also confirmed the exchange. Zelenskyy said on Thursday that Russia’s defence of Iran’s authorities underscored the need for intensified sanctions against Moscow. Its deployment of Iranian-designed Shahed drones and North Korean munitions was proof that Kyiv’s allies were applying insufficient pressure against the Kremlin. “When one of their accomplices loses their capability to export war, Russia is weakened and tries to interfere. This is so cynical and proves time and again that aggressive regimes cannot be allowed to unite and become partners.” The Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said the conflict between Israel and Iran had exposed Russian hypocrisy, with Moscow condemning strikes against Tehran while “ruthlessly” attacking Ukraine. “The only rational conclusion is that Russia cannot be trusted in any situation, and it is always part of the problem rather than the solution.” The funeral has been held in Kyiv for Ukrainian soldier and former actor Yuriy Felipenko, who was killed on the frontline aged 32. Before joining the army in April 2024, Felipenko starred in several stage productions and TV shows, playing a lead role in Ukrainian crime serial The Colour of Passion. Fighting between Iran and Israel could deflect global attention from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and even bolster the Kremlin’s war effort, a senior Ukrainian political source told AFP. The conflict has pushed up the price of oil and “for Ukraine, the challenge is the price of oil, because if prices remain high for a long time, the Russians will earn more”. However, Kyiv has welcomed Israeli attacks on a country that has directly aided and provided weapons to Russia. Denmark when it takes over the presidency of the European Council will continue preparing Ukraine for EU membership against the objections of Hungary, the Danish Europe minister, Marie Bjerre, said on Thursday. The Danish presidency begins on 1 July. “Unfortunately, Hungary is blocking and we are trying to put as much pressure there as we can and also do everything we can to make Ukraine continue with the necessary reform work,” said Bjerre."
world/2025/feb/22/ukraine-war-briefing-trump-turnaround-as-he-acknowledges-russia-invaded-ukraine,Ukraine war briefing: Trump turnaround as he acknowledges Russia invaded Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/22/ukraine-war-briefing-trump-turnaround-as-he-acknowledges-russia-invaded-ukraine,Ukraine war briefing: Trump turnaround as he acknowledges Russia invaded Ukraine,"Donald Trump has reversed course to admit that Russia did in fact invade Ukraine. In an interview with Fox News radio on Friday, he acknowledged Russia had invaded Ukraine on the order of Vladimir Putin, but said Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, and then-US president Joe Biden, should have averted it. “They shouldn’t have let him attack.” The US president had said on Tuesday that Ukraine “should have never started” the war three years ago, prompting criticism domestically and internationally. Trump predicted a minerals agreement with Ukraine would be “signed hopefully in the next fairly short period of time”. The White House national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said on Friday that Zelenskyy was expected to sign a deal imminently. Zelenskyy said on Friday that Ukrainian and US teams were working on a draft agreement. “I am hoping for … a fair result,” he said. Zelenskyy on Wednesday rejected US demands for $500bn in mineral wealth from Ukraine to repay Washington for wartime aid, saying the US had supplied nowhere near that sum so far and had offered no specific security guarantees. US negotiators on the minerals deal threatened to cut Ukraine’s access to Starlink, Reuters reported, citing three sources familiar with the matter. Starlink provides crucial internet acces to Ukraine and its military. The issue was raised again on Thursday during meetings between Keith Kellogg, the US special Ukraine envoy, and Zelenskyy, one of the sources said. During the meeting, Ukraine was told it faced losing Starlink if it did not reach a minerals deal, said the source, who requested anonymity to discuss closed negotiations. Zelenskyy said after a flurry of phone calls with leaders of allied countries that Europe “must and can do much more to ensure that peace is actually achieved” in Ukraine. “It is possible” to achieve an end to the war with Russia since Ukraine and its partners in Europe have “clear proposals”, he added. “On this basis we can ensure the implementation of a European strategy, and it is important that this is done together with America.” The US has proposed a UN resolution on the war that omits any mention of Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia, diplomatic sources told Agence France-Presse. It appeared to rival a draft resolution produced by Ukraine and its European allies that stresses the need to redouble diplomatic efforts to end the war this year. Washington’s text on Friday called for a “swift end to the conflict” without mentioning Kyiv’s territorial integrity, and was welcomed by Moscow’s ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, as “a good move”. A Russian drone attack killed a rail worker at a crossing outside Kyiv and falling drone fragments struck a building in the capital, local authorities said on Saturday. Kyiv region officials said the rail worker was killed in Boryspil district to the east. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said drone fragments fell on private residences in the Solomyanskyi district to the west, triggering a fire and smashing windows in a nearby building. There were no casualties. Air raid alerts were in effect in Kyiv for about three hours. In Ukraine’s southern Zaporizhzhia region, Russian forces attacked the town of Huliaipole with a guided bomb, injuring three people, the regional governor said. One person died on Thursday in a attack on a village west of Huliaipole. The accounts of military activity could not be independently verified. Kellogg has praised Zelenskyy as “the embattled and courageous leader of a nation at war”, striking a dramatically different tone from Donald Trump, who has falsely called Ukraine’s president a “dictator”, reports Luke Harding in Kyiv. Kellogg left Kyiv on Friday after a three-day visit. Posting on social media, he said he had engaged in “extensive and positive discussions” with Zelenskyy and his “talented national security team”. Keir Starmer will not risk riling Trump by challenging him over his attack on Zelenskyy when the pair finally meet next week, as the British prime minister seeks to cool an escalating transatlantic row, reports Kiran Stacey. Starmer will fly to the US for what could be a defining moment for his leadership, as Europe and the US trade accusations and insults about the origins of the war in Ukraine and the best way to end it. Trump added to the tensions on Friday when he accused Starmer and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, of having done nothing to help end the war. Russia could agree to using $300bn of sovereign assets frozen in Europe for reconstruction in Ukraine but will insist that part of the money is spent on the fifth of the country that Moscow’s forces control, three sources told Reuters. While Russia-US discussions are at a very early stage, one idea being floated in Moscow is that Russia could propose using a large chunk of the frozen reserves as part of a possible peace deal, according to the sources with knowledge of the matter. Russia and the US held their first face-to-face talks on ending the Ukraine war on 18 February in Saudi Arabia. A Polish court has handed an eight-year prison term to a Ukrainian man convicted of planning acts of sabotage and arson on Russia’s behalf. The court in the south-western city of Wroclaw on Friday found the 51-year-old man, identified only as Serhyi S, guilty of being part of a criminal ring and of preparing to set fire to various structures in the city. Polish state security officers arrested him in January 2024. Authorities said he was preparing to set fire to a factory. He denied intending sabotage but admitted to accepting orders to commit arson in return for money. Four other people have been charged in the case."

Trump said Zelenskyy and Putin were going to set up a meeting to try to reach a ceasefire to end the war in Ukraine. “Now, it’s really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity after his meeting with Putin. “And I would also say the European nations, they have to get involved a little bit. But it’s up to President Zelenskyy … And if they’d like, I’ll be at that next meeting.” Trump said the direct talks with Putin on Friday did not yield an agreement to pause the war in Ukraine, though he claimed “great progress” during the nearly three-hour-long summit. “I believe we had a very productive meeting,” the US president said at a joint press conference with Putin after the talks. “There were many, many points that we agreed on.” Putin, speaking through an interpreter, suggested the two leaders had hammered out “an understanding”. He said he expected Ukraine and its European allies to accept the results of the US-Russia negotiation constructively and not try to “disrupt the emerging progress”. The Russian leader agreed that Ukraine’s security must be guaranteed – but also said that the “root causes” of the conflict must be resolved. Zelenskyy said Russia was continuing to attack Ukraine ahead of the Trump-Putin summit, but claimed its attempt to “show strength” with a new assault in the east had failed. “On the day of the negotiations, they also kill people. And that says a lot,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram on Friday. “The war continues. It continues precisely because there is no order, nor any indication that Moscow is preparing to end this war.” Ukraine said it had conducted a long-range drone attack on a supply ship that it claims was carrying drone components from Iran, hours before the Trump-Putin summit. Photographs showed a partially sunken cargo vessel at Olya, near Astrakhan, north of the Caspian Sea. Ukraine’s military claimed credit for the attack and the overnight bombing of an oil refinery at Samara on the Volga River, deep inside Russia. Ukraine’s general staff said the ship was “loaded with components” for Shahed-type drones “and ammunition from Iran”. Russia launched a ballistic missile into Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region hours before the Trump-Putin summit, killing one person and wounding at least one other, and causing a fire. “A truck and a minibus were damaged in a hostile attack on the Dnipro district. A man was killed. Another person was injured,” the regional governor, Serhiy Lysak, said on Telegram. The city of Dnipro is a logistics hub for Ukrainian forces. The Ukrainian military says it has retaken six villages in the east that Russia captured in a push this week. On Tuesday, Russia made a swift advance to the town of Dobropillia, piercing through Ukraine’s defences. “The advance of the enemy was stopped by the forces of the 1st Corps of the National Guard of Ukraine (NGU) ‘Azov’, together with adjacent and subordinate units, over the past three days,” Ukraine’s general staff said. The town is now under constant Russian drone and shell fire. Ukrainian military intelligence claimed that Russia is preparing to test its new nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered cruise missile and, if successful, plans to use the results to bolster its negotiating position with the west. Military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov told Reuters that Moscow saw the test as diplomatic leverage. “Russia is preparing for another round of tests of the 9M730 Burevestnik,” his statement said. “The purpose of these tests is to validate scientific and technical solutions implemented by the missile. If successful, Russia will leverage the test results to defend its interests in negotiations.”"

Russian forces had pushed further into Pokrovsk and its environs, though much of it remained beyond firm control of either side, mapping by the Ukrainian project DeepState indicated on Tuesday. “The situation remains critical,” said Deepstate, adding that in some districts Russian forces were digging in and building up positions. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in its most recent assessment at time of writing, posted on 3 November: “Russian forces continue to advance in the Pokrovsk direction and appear to be operating with increasing comfort within Pokrovsk itself.” The ISW added that Ukrainian forces had liberated a significant portion of a Russian penetration in the Dobropillia direction, on the eastern flank of the Pokrovsk effort. Ukrainian long-range drones attacked an industrial plant about 1,300km inside Russia at Sterlitamak, local officials said on Tuesday. The city administration reported an explosion at the Sterlitamak Petrochemical Plant that caused its water treatment facility to partially collapse, adding that the cause of the explosion was not known. The Ukrainian military general staff said there was “considerable damage” to the plant. Ukraine’s military said it struck a Lukoil oil refinery at Kstovo in Russia’s Nizhny Novgorod region east of Moscow. The extent of the damage was being assessed, it said. The Russian regional governor confirmed an attack by 20 drones near Kstovo. Russian military reservists will now have to guard oil refineries against Ukrainian drone strikes after Vladimir Putin signed a law on Tuesday extending their entanglement in the war effort. The Russian ruler also signed a law allowing military conscription all year round whereas previously it was possible only during limited periods in autumn and spring. Moscow legally bars conscripts from being deployed to combat, but after their military they enter Russia’s reserves, put them at risk of being sent to war. Heavy military spending has also started to strain the Russian state budget, with Moscow raising taxes to plug a rising deficit. Zelenskyy urged the US to remain open to supplying Kyiv with long-range weapons. Addressing a European Union summit from the Pokrovsk area, the Ukrainian president also called for more western sanctions on Russia – including on Russia’s gas and nuclear sectors – and said he wanted Ukraine to join the EU before 2030. Germany plans to raise its military aid to Ukraine by €3bn next year to about €11.5bn, the finance ministry in Berlin said on Tuesday. “This includes, among other things, artillery, drones, armoured vehicles and the replacement of two Patriot systems,” a ministry spokesman told AFP. Norwegian munitions maker Nammo has signed a letter of intent with a Ukrainian industrial partner to produce, develop and sell ammunition in Ukraine, Norway’s government said. Italy summoned Russia’s deputy ambassador on Tuesday to protest at what it said were “vulgar”, “disturbing” and “unacceptable” remarks by Moscow’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who linked the deadly collapse of a tower in Rome to Italy’s military support for Ukraine. The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said: “Italy will not alter its foreign policy stance or its principles in response to reckless verbal attacks”. The Russian embassy in Rome later posted condolences for the death of Romanian worker Octav Stroici in the collapse but took the opportunity to complain that the angry response to Zakharova’s comments was anti-Russian."
world/2025/nov/03/ukraine-war-briefing-trump-not-really-considering-supplying-tomahawks,Ukraine war briefing: Trump ‘not really’ considering supplying Tomahawks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/ukraine-war-briefing-trump-not-really-considering-supplying-tomahawks,Ukraine war briefing: Trump ‘not really’ considering supplying Tomahawks,"Donald Trump said on Sunday he was not really considering supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles. Asked about it by a reporter aboard Air Force One, Trump responded: “No, not really.” He added, however, that he could change his mind. Reports in recent days said the Pentagon had told the White House that the US stockpile of Tomahawks was sufficient to be able to supply them to Ukraine. Ukraine has been seeking the Tomahawk missiles to carry out long-range strikes against Russia, but without them has still been able to wage a successful campaign using its own drones and missiles against Russian military and strategic targets such as oil depots and refineries. A Ukrainian drone attack struck Russia’s Tuapse oil port on the Black Sea on Sunday, causing a fire and damaging two ships, according to Russian authorities. Russian airports in nearby regions also had to be closed. Turkey’s largest oil refineries are buying more non-Russian oil in response to the latest western sanctions on Russia, Reuters reported, citing two sources with direct knowledge of the matter and other industry sources. Turkey is a major buyer of Russian crude along with China and India but refiners are following India in cutting back. One of the largest Turkish refineries, SOCAR Turkey Aegean Refinery (STAR), owned by Azeri company SOCAR, has recently bought four cargoes of crude from Iraq, Kazakhstan and other non-Russian producers for December arrival, according to the sources. This amounts to 77,000 to 129,000 barrels per day (bpd) of non-Russian supply depending on cargo size, based on Reuters calculations; whereas Russian crude amounted to virtually all of the STAR refinery’s crude intake in October and September of about 210,000 bpd, according to trade data. SOCAR declined to comment, Reuters said. The other major Turkish refiner – Tupras – was increasing purchases of non-Russian grades, two of the sources said. Tupras was also likely soon to completely phase out Russian crude imports at one of its two major Turkish plants so that it could maintain fuel exports to Europe without falling foul of the EU’s incoming sanctions, two sources said. Tupras did not respond to a request for comment, Reuters said. Ukraine has deployed special forces to the embattled eastern city of Pokrovsk in an attempt to push back an intense Russian assault involving thousands of troops, Kyiv’s top commander has said. Ashifa Kassam writes in a detailed report on the situation that Pokrovsk, dubbed “the gateway to Donetsk”, lies on a major supply route for the Ukrainian army and has been in Moscow’s sights for more than a year as Russia pushes to control the entire eastern Donetsk region. At least 200 Russian soldiers had penetrated Pokrovsk’s defences, Kyiv said last week, while the Institute for the Study of War assessed that others were closing in on its outskirts in a pincer-shaped movement. In his evening address on Sunday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, spoke of the fighting in Pokrovsk and “results in the destruction of the occupiers”. Zelenskyy, who has been pushing his allies for more air defences to hold off Russia’s attacks, announced on Sunday that Ukraine had strengthened its air-defence network with Germany’s support. “We have strengthened the Patriot component of our Ukrainian air defence,” Zelenskyy said, referring to the US-made advanced air-defence systems. Without offering further details, the Ukrainian leader singled out Germany and its chancellor, Friedrich Merz, for thanks. Russian drones and missiles fired at Ukraine killed at least six people including two children and cut power to tens of thousands, officials said on Sunday. Russian forces attacked the Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa regions, said the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general. The children were two boys aged 11 and 14, said Ukraine’s human rights commissioner, Dmytro Lubinets. Russia’s attacks cut power to the entire eastern Donetsk region as well as almost 58,000 households in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, their governors said. Ukraine’s Vostok army group said some of its personnel were killed in one of the Russian strikes on Dnipropetrovsk."

There were strikes in 12 locations in four central districts of the city, the mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said on Telegram. Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the attacks, saying dozens of drones had been launched and issuing a fresh appeal to beef up Ukraine’s air defence capability. “There were no military targets, nor could there be any,” the Ukrainian president said on Telegram. “Russia strikes dwellings when Ukrainians are in their homes, when they are putting their children to bed.” Terekhov said a house had also been hit in the city, 30km from the country’s north-eastern border, and an 11-year-old child was among those hurt. The number of injured could rise, said the regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov. The attacks came hours after Russian strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia wounded more than 20 people. The US state department has approved the potential sale of F-16 training and sustainment as well as related equipment to Ukraine for $310m, the Pentagon said. Friday’s move comes just days after Ukraine and the US signed a much-discussed agreement to share proceeds from the sale of Ukrainian minerals and rare earths and fund investment in Ukraine’s reconstruction. Ukraine has previously received F-16 jets from US allies under a jet transfer authorised by former president Joe Biden’s administration, while Trump paused all Ukraine-related military aid shortly after taking office. Ukraine’s parliament will hold a vote on 8 May to ratify the minerals deal, a legislator said on Friday, while the prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, suggested the agreement would help Kyiv with air defences. “This agreement will allow us to better defend our country here and now – to better protect our skies thanks to American air defence systems,” Shmyhal said at the governmental meeting. Ukraine’s internal security agency accused Russian intelligence of orchestrating an attempt to assassinate a prominent Ukrainian blogger, accusing a 45-year-old woman of carrying out the failed hit. The attempt to kill internet personality Serhii Sternenko took place on Thursday. The SBU security agency said on Telegram on Friday that the woman – whom it did not name – had fired several shots with a pistol, one of which hit Sternenko in the leg. The blogger said there was no danger to his life. The woman’s lawyer said in court that she did not contest the facts of the case. Russia’s FSB security service and its military intelligence agency did not immediately reply to Reuters requests for comment. Four people were injured in a Russian joint drone and artillery attack on localities east of Nikopol in south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, regional authorities said. In southern Ukraine’s Kherson region, a village resident died when a fallen drone exploded as he was trying to carry it away from a house. In Russia, the Black Sea coast of the Krasnodar region was struck in a “massive attack” from Ukrainian forces, the regional governor said. Three apartment blocks in Novorossiysk were damaged, Veniamin Kondratyev said, and according to a preliminary toll four people were injured, including two children. Russia’s defence ministry said on Friday its forces were continuing to create a “security strip” in border areas of northern Ukraine’s Sumy region after driving Ukrainian troops out of the Kursk region, just across the border in western Russia. Ukraine says its forces still have a foothold in Kursk but it is concerned about a possible Russian advance into Sumy. Two Majors, a pro-Russian war blogger, said Russia was developing an offensive from Zhuravka to Bilovody, two villages just over the border in Sumy. The reports could not be verified. People from the west African nation of Togo have been captured and detained by Ukrainian armed forces after taking part “in military operations alongside Russian armed forces”, Togolese authorities said Friday. The “majority of compatriots, in particular young students, had left Togo under alleged scholarships offered by structures claiming to be based in Russia”, the foreign ministry said in a statement. The Martin Luther King Movement, Togo’s leading human rights organisation, alerted authorities in March to the case of a Togolese student captured on the battlefield and imprisoned in Ukraine. US officials have finalised new economic sanctions against Russia, including banking and energy measures, to intensify pressure on Moscow to embrace Donald Trump’s efforts to end its war on Ukraine, according to three US officials and a source familiar with the issue. Reuters reports the targets include state-owned Russian energy company Gazprom and major entities involved in the natural resources and banking sectors, one official said, requesting anonymity. But it was not clear if the package would get Trump’s approval, the official said. Greek authorities have remanded in custody a man suspected of photographing supply convoys on behalf of Russia in the Greek port city of Alexandroupolis, a judicial source said. The 59-year-old Greek man of Georgian descent was arrested Tuesday and taken before an investigating magistrate for a hearing on Friday. A police source alleged to Agence France-Presse that the suspect was targeting military convoys to Ukraine, according to footage retrieved from his mobile phone. But during Friday’s hearing the suspect said he had “done nothing illegal”, according to a judicial source."
film/2025/aug/29/brent-renaud-armed-only-camera-documentary,‘Brent’s end was poetic’: the life and death of first US journalist killed in Russia-Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/29/brent-renaud-armed-only-camera-documentary,‘Brent’s end was poetic’: the life and death of first US journalist killed in Russia-Ukraine war,"It’s a journalist’s role to stay behind the scenes. But sometimes, a reporter’s extraordinary life becomes the story itself. Such is the case with Brent Renaud, an award-winning documentary film-maker who was the first American journalist killed, at the age of 50, in the Russia-Ukraine war. His life and death are captured in a new, intimate documentary that debuted in Los Angeles at the 21st annual HollyShorts film festival earlier this month. The film, entitled Armed Only With a Camera, is directed by Craig Renaud, Brent’s younger brother, who worked alongside him for more than 20 years, and produced by the photojournalist Juan Arredondo, who was there on the day Brent died. It explores Brent’s time as a journalist and documentarian reporting worldwide from places such as the US-Mexico border, Haiti and Ukraine, relying heavily on the footage Brent filmed during their travels. The brothers’ work has won a multitude of awards including an Emmy, a Peabody, two duPont–Columbia awards, two Overseas Press Club awards, an International Documentary Association (IDA) award, a Webby and an Edward R Murrow award. After setting out to follow a family in Ukraine for an independent film the brothers were producing, Brent and Arredondo were gunned down by Russian soldiers on 13 March 2022. Arredondo was heavily wounded; Brent was shot in the neck and did not survive. “According to the driver, [the ambush] wasn’t more than five minutes,” said Arredondo. “But for me, it just felt an eternity.” The film captures harrowing scenes from that day, filmed by Brent in his last moments. The events following the attack were filmed by Craig and Christof Putzel, a producer of the film and trusted colleague who worked alongside the Renaud brothers in many conflict zones over the years. Arredondo, despite his injuries, was determined to give an accurate account of what happened to his friend. “The bullet came through, entered the body, and at that point, I started fainting, because I was profusely losing blood. I kept telling people: ‘Where’s my friend? He’s back. Please go get him,”’ Arredondo said. “And when I finally came to my senses, the first thing was I needed to call Craig. I made a purpose in my mind to be as accurate as possible, because I wasn’t sure if I was going to survive.” Craig left the United States shortly after to retrieve Brent’s body and his final recordings from Ukraine, and bring them to his home town in Arkansas. “I remember packing to leave for Ukraine frantically,” he said. “And I remember looking over at my camera. I could hear Brent so clearly: ‘Of course you’re taking your camera.’” Craig wanted to make sure he captured his brother’s story in its entirety. Brent’s life work is showcased throughout the documentary, including clips that often capture the stories of civilians caught in the crossfire. Archival footage of Brent and his family as he grew up give the audience a glimpse into who he was in front of the camera, not just behind it. The decision to turn Brent’s story into a documentary was an easy one for Craig, he said: “We spent our entire career, over 20 years, documenting other people caught in these wars. Why would it be any different when it’s my family member or my brother being killed? It was an instinctual thing.” In addition to Brent’s story, the film highlights the growing risks that journalists face around the world during what the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has called the deadliest time to tell the truth. The committee has reported that 15 other journalists died in the Russia-Ukraine war from 2022 to 2023. CPJ has also reported that at least 124 journalists were killed in 2024 – the majority of them in Gaza – surpassing the previous record of 113 journalists killed in 2007, when almost 50% of casualties were attributed to the Iraq war. Brent’s dedication to the craft of journalism continued until his final breath, said Craig: “When Brent died, I was at peace with his death immediately. There was no part of me that felt like this isn’t how Brent was supposed to die. You know, he was the most dedicated journalist I’ve ever known. That being the end to Brent is poetic.” Craig and his family have started the Brent Renaud Foundation, which aims to continue Brent’s legacy by mentoring youth on the arts of storytelling and cinema, as well as training the next generation of journalists for the difficult work that lies ahead of them. “Without journalism, there is no democracy. I hope people, when they see this film, really think about where we are as a nation and in the world with journalism,” said Craig. Armed Only With a Camera: The Life and Death of Brent Renaud has just received the Audience award at SXSW and will be available to stream on HBO on 21 October 2025 This article was amended on 29 August 2025 to reflect that Brent Renaud was 50, not 51, when he died."

More than 15 apartments were on fire in a five-storey building and several houses were hit. Terekhov added “there may be people trapped under the rubble”. Separately the death toll rose to at least three with 13 wounded after Russia attacked Kyiv and Odesa with waves of drones and missiles early on Tuesday. The civilian targets hit included a maternity ward and a cathedral. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, voiced his frustration with Donald Trump by calling for “concrete actions” rather than “silence” after seven of the Ukrainian capital’s 10 districts were hit, writes Daniel Boffey from Kyiv. Another exchange of prisoners of war took place on Tuesday, after a swap on Monday, pursuant to the only tangible deal struck at the most recent Ukraine-Russia talks in Turkey. Among them were soldiers captured in the battle for Mariupol over three years ago, said Ukrainian authorities. All of those freed had severe injuries and illnesses, including amputated limbs and vision problems. Russia’s defence ministry said it also received a group of soldiers. Amina Ivanchenko was reunited on Monday with her husband, a PoW for 18 months, in the initial release. She said was grateful to Ukrainian officials for supporting her. “My struggle was much easier thanks to them. Our country will definitely return everyone. Glory to Ukraine! Thank you!” The European Commission proposed on Tuesday an 18th package of sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, aimed at Moscow’s energy revenues, its banks and its military industry. Among the measures, Jennifer Rankin writes from Brussels, the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has proposed that western countries reduce the price at which Russian oil can be sold to $45 (£30) a barrel, down from $60. Oil exports, she added, represented one-third of Russian government revenues. “We need to cut this source of revenues.” The EU executive also wants to impose restrictions on doing business with the companies involved in the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines, to prevent them being revived; impose restrictions on doing business with 22 banks, cutting them off from the Swift financial messaging system; and add more ships to the banned “shadow fleet” list as well as sanctioning oil trading companies. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said shadow fleet sanctions were having a marked impact. “When sanctioned, Russia’s shadow fleet tankers cannot dock in ports and Russia has to find new vessels. This costs some more and runs down their profits.”"

Ukraine’s air force said on Sunday that Russia had fired 477 drones and decoys as well as 60 missiles overnight. While 475 of these were shot down or lost, the onslaught marked the “most massive airstrike” on the country since Russia began its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Yuriy Ihnat, head of communications for Ukraine’s air force, told the Associated Press. The bombing appeared to target several regions far from the frontline, he said, including in western Ukraine. The Russian army said on Sunday its overnight attack hit Ukrainian military-industrial complex sites and oil refineries, and that it had intercepted three Ukrainian drones overnight. The scale of the attacks called into question comments made on Friday by Vladimir Putin, in which the Russian president said that Moscow was ready for a fresh round of direct peace talks in Istanbul. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Sunday that the barrage of bombs in fact showed that Putin had decided to pursue war. “Moscow will not stop as long as it has the capability to launch massive strikes,” Zelenskyy wrote on social media. In the past week alone, Russia had attacked Ukraine with more than 114 missiles, more than 1,270 drones and nearly 1,100 glide bombs, he said. “This war must be brought to an end – pressure on the aggressor is needed, and so is protection,” he added. “Ukraine needs to strengthen its air defence – the thing that best protects lives.” He reiterated Ukraine’s willingness to buy US air defence systems, adding that his country counted on the “leadership, political will, and support of the United States, Europe and all our partners”. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s air force said an F-16 warplane supplied by its western partners had crashed after sustaining damage while shooting down air targets, killing the pilot. “The pilot used all of his onboard weapons and shot down seven air targets. While shooting down the last one, his aircraft was damaged and began to lose altitude,” the air force said on Telegram. The pilot did not have time to eject, it added. Local officials in Ukraine said the strikes had killed two people and injured at least 12, including two children. As air raid sirens rang out across the country, residents in Kyiv took refuge in bomb shelters and metro stations, while in the city of Drohobych, in the western Lviv region, a large fire broke out at an industrial facility after a drone attack that cut electricity to parts of the city. Explosions were heard in Kyiv, Lviv, Poltava, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy and the Ivano-Frankivsk regions, witnesses and regional governors told Reuters. Russia’s escalating campaign comes as talks on ending the fighting remain largely at an impasse. Two recent rounds between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul yielded no progress. On Sunday, Ukraine’s presidential website said the country had begun the process of withdrawing from the international treaty banning antipersonnel landmines. A senior Ukrainian lawmaker, Roman Kostenko, said on social media that parliamentary approval was still needed. “This is a step that the reality of war has long demanded,” he said. “Russia is not a party to this convention and is massively using mines against our military and civilians. We cannot remain tied down in an environment where the enemy has no restrictions.” In recent months, and to an outcry from anti-mine campaigners, five European countries have announced similar plans to withdraw from the 1997 landmark mine ban treaty, citing concerns about the growing threat of Russia."
world/2025/may/20/ukraine-war-briefing-europe-proceeds-with-russia-sanctions-after-trump-putin-talk,Ukraine war briefing: Europe proceeds with Russia sanctions after Trump-Putin talk,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/20/ukraine-war-briefing-europe-proceeds-with-russia-sanctions-after-trump-putin-talk,Ukraine war briefing: Europe proceeds with Russia sanctions after Trump-Putin talk,"European leaders have agreed to increase pressure on Russia through further sanctions after Donald Trump briefed them on his call with Vladimir Putin, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said late on Monday. “Europe will increase the pressure on Moscow through sanctions. This is what we agreed upon with [Trump] after his conversation with Putin,” Merz posted on X, saying “Europe and America are very united on this”. After speaking with Putin, Trump held calls with the leaders of the European Union, France, Italy, Germany and Finland. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Kyiv and its partners were considering arranging a high-level meeting between Ukraine, Russia, the US, EU countries and Britain. The Ukrainian leader said he hoped the meeting could happen as soon as possible and that it could be hosted by Turkey, the Vatican or Switzerland. Zelensky said US sanctions on Russia had the power to “determine” Moscow’s ability to continue its invasion. “The European package will be there, and it will be strong,” Zelenskyy said. “As for the United States package, that is a different story. Here, we all need to work hard with the United States of America so that at some point, when they are able to, they will impose appropriate sanctions.” Last week, Merz said new sanctions against Russia would be adopted in Brussels on Tuesday 20 May. Trump said on Monday that he would not impose further sanctions on Russia – “I think there’s a chance of getting something done, and if you do that, you could also make it much worse.” Trump claimed after his Putin call that Russia and Ukraine will immediately start ceasefire negotiations but did not appear to have secured major concessions. The Kremlin said Putin and Trump had not discussed a timeline for a ceasefire but that Trump had stressed his interest in reaching agreements quickly. Putin said after the call that Russia was ready to work toward ending the fighting, starting with Ukraine and Russia setting out a “memorandum on a possible future peace accord”. The Russian leader said Istanbul talks last week between Moscow and Kyiv put the world on the “right path” towards ending the conflict – which began with Moscow’s full-scale 2022 offensive. European and US leaders welcomed Pope Leo XIV’s readiness to host Russia-Ukraine talks at the Vatican, said the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. “Italy is ready to do its part to facilitate contacts and work for peace,” Meloni added. Zelenskyy ruled out withdrawing troops from land claimed by Russia, rejecting demands put forward by Russia. “No one will withdraw our troops from our territories,” Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv when asked about Moscow’s demands for Ukraine to fully abandon the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions – four regions that Russia claims to have annexed but does not fully control. Amnesty International said it would keep up investigations on Russia despite Moscow declaring the rights group an “undesirable organisation”, effectively banning its operations and exposing supporters to prosecution. Amnesty said the Kremlin would not deter its efforts to document rights abuses, including alleged war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine. “This decision is part of the Russian government’s broader effort to silence dissent and isolate civil society,” said the Amnesty secretary general, Agnès Callamard."

The Ukrainian president said he believed Russia could be “pushed” to stop the war. “But if the world doesn’t aim to change the regime in Russia, that means even after the war ends, Moscow will still try to destabilise neighbouring countries,” he said on Thursday, speaking virtually to a conference marking the 50th anniversary of the cold war-era Helsinki accords. Russia’s overnight strikes wounded at least 150 people, authorities said. The death toll previously stood at 16, including two children, but was revised on Friday after rescuers retrieved 10 bodies from the rubble of a residential building in the Sviatoshynsky district, including the body of a two-year-old child, according to the interior ministry. Russia fired more than 300 drones and eight cruise missiles at Ukraine – with Kyiv the main target – from late Wednesday to early Thursday, the Ukrainian air force said. One missile tore through a nine-storey residential building in the capital’s west, ripping off its facade, authorities said. Zelenskyy said the injured including 16 children and six police officers. It was the largest number of children hurt in a single attack on Kyiv during the war, the rescue service said. Donald Trump criticised Russia’s actions in Ukraine, suggesting new sanctions against Moscow were coming. “Russia – I think it’s disgusting what they’re doing,” the US president said on Thursday. “We’re going to put sanctions,” he said, before adding: “I don’t know that sanctions bother him,” referring to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Russia’s attack came just days after Trump issued a 10-to-12-day ultimatum for Moscow to halt its invasion or face sanctions. The Ukrainian parliament has passed a law restoring independence to two anti-corruption bodies, essentially annulling another law adopted last week that prompted the biggest street protests since Russia’s full-scale invasion three years ago, reports Shaun Walker. Several hundred protesters outside the parliament building in Kyiv erupted into chants of “the people are the power” as the bill passed on Thursday. Volodymyr Zelenskyy will hope the new law will put an end to what had threatened to become a political crisis domestically and had worried European allies. He signed the law into force swiftly after the vote. Russia claimed on Thursday that it had captured the Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar, a strategically important military hub in the eastern Donetsk region. Zelenskyy called Moscow’s claim “Russian disinformation”, saying: “Ukrainian units are defending our positions.” Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Kovalenko said Russian forces “have full control over the entire northern and eastern part” of Chasiv Yar, including districts that had been hardest to get. But he said fighting for the western side was ongoing, with the situation “very difficult”. The battlefields reports could not be independently verified."

A two-year-old was among the five children found dead after Thursday’s Russian drone and missile attack, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Friday, announcing the end of the rescue operation. A total of 159 people were wounded in the strikes, which saw Russia launch more than 300 drones and eight missiles early on Thursday. The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, described Thursday’s attacks as “depraved” and posted a picture of the bloc’s flag at half mast. “More weapons for Ukraine and tougher sanctions on Russia are the fastest way to end the war. Getting more air defences to Ukraine fast is our priority,” she added in a post. Zelenskyy has been appealing to allies for more air defence systems and on Friday, Germany said it would soon start delivering two more US-made Patriot launchers to Ukraine. Germany has already delivered three Patriot systems to Ukraine since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Russia’s military advance in Ukraine accelerated for a fourth straight month in July, according to AFP’s analysis of data from the US-based Institute for the Study of War. From August 2024 to July 2025, the Russian army captured nearly 5,900 sq km, compared with 1,360 sq km in the previous 12 months. In July, the Russian army took 713 sq km of Ukrainian territory, while Ukraine reclaimed 79 sq km. Nearly three-quarters of Russian advances in July were in the eastern Donetsk region. Moscow fully or partially controlled 78% of the region at the end of July, compared with 62% a year ago. About 31% of this region was already under the control of pro-Russian separatists before the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion. Donald Trump has said that he deployed nuclear-capable submarines to the “appropriate regions” in response to a threatening tweet by Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev. In a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump wrote that he had decided to reposition the nuclear submarines because of “highly provocative statements” by Medvedev, who had earlier said Trump’s threats to sanction Russia and a recent ultimatum were “a threat and a step towards war”. Vladimir Putin has said he wants a “lasting and stable peace” in Ukraine but gave no indication that he is willing to make any concessions to achieve it. The Russian president told journalists on Friday that a peace would need to be built on “solid foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and would ensure the security of both countries”. Seemingly referencing Trump’s comments that he was “disappointed” with Putin, the Russian leader added: “All disappointments arise from inflated expectations.” Europe must start seeing the Ukrainian military as a European army, the prominent Russian opposition activist Ilya Yashin told hundreds of Russian exiles in Serbia on Friday. “The Ukrainian army is not only protecting Ukraine, it is protecting Europe from Russian aggression,” he said in a speech at a Belgrade concert hall. Yashin was imprisoned in 2022 for criticising Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and released last year. Between February 2022 and 2024, more than 74,000 Russians registered for temporary residence in Serbia, according to the latest interior ministry data."

Hours after Ukraine and European leaders called for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire to start on Monday, the Russian president proposed holding direct talks in Istanbul on Thursday. “We don’t exclude that during these negotiations we will be able to agree on new ceasefires,” Putin said on Sunday. Hours earlier, European leaders on a joint visit to Kyiv issued the ultimatum to Putin. The leaders of the UK, France, Germany and Poland, together with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made a joint phone call to Donald Trump prior to making the announcement. It was the first time the leaders of the four European nations had made a joint visit to Ukraine. “We are clear the bloodshed must end. Russia must stop its illegal invasion,” the leaders said in a joint statement. Zelenskyy told a news conference after their talks that the ceasefire should cover air, sea and land, and that if Moscow refused, it would face new sanctions, including the strengthening of punitive measures targeting its energy and banking sectors. The Kremlin accused European countries on Saturday of making contradictory and confrontational statements, Interfax news agency reported. “We hear many contradictory statements from Europe. They are generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations. Nothing more,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying. In an earlier interview with ABC News, Peskov said Russia would require a halt to US and European arms supplies to Ukraine during any potential ceasefire. “Otherwise it will be an advantage for Ukraine. Ukraine will continue their total mobilisation, bringing new troops to front line.” Keir Starmer has said there is “absolute unity” of countries around the world on Ukraine. Speaking from Kyiv on Saturday, the UK prime minister was asked if he believed Vladimir Putin wanted peace and why he thought the threat of sanctions would work. Starmer replied: “There’s only one country that stands between peace, and that’s Russia.” Starmer said that “all of us here, together with US, are calling Putin out”, adding that if the Russian president was “serious” about peace then “he has a chance to show it now by extending the VE Day pause into a full, unconditional 30-day ceasefire”. Starmer also said UK experts and European partners were working to “boost Ukraine’s economy” in an attempt to support the invaded country’s long-term stability. Speaking at the “coalition of the willing” meeting in Kyiv on Saturday, he said “securing Ukraine’s future for the longer term” had been discussed, with measures including the resumption of flights to Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces had made four more attempts in the past 24 hours to break across the border into Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions. Reuters could not independently verify the claim. Ukraine says Russia has continued to attack it and has called Moscow’s three-day ceasefire a “farce”. On Saturday morning, local officials in Ukraine’s northern Sumy region said Russian shelling over the past day had killed three residents and injured four more. Another civilian died on the spot on Saturday as a Russian drone struck the southern city of Kherson, according to regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin. An Associated Press tally, based on reports from Ukrainian authorities, found at least 117 civilians had been killed and more than 1,000 injured in Russian aerial attacks since Ukraine announced on 11 March its willingness for a ceasefire."

Kyiv, its surrounding region and the eastern half of Ukraine were under air raid alerts, according to Ukraine’s air force. Russia said one person died when a drone hit a car in the Rostov region, while at least 59 Ukrainian drones were launched at Russian areas, including Rostov, Astrakhan, Voronezh, Volgograd, Kursk and Saratov, as well as over illegally Russian-occupied Crimea. Russian authorities made their usual broad claim that all Ukrainian drones were shot down. Talks between US and Ukrainian officials are scheduled to begin on Sunday in Saudi Arabia. A Washington source briefed on the planning of the meetings said the US side would be led by Andrew Peek of the national security council and Michael Anton of the state department, Reuters reported. After US officials meet the Ukrainians on Sunday night, they will meet Russian officials on Monday, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said earlier this week, however, that Ukrainian officials would be present at the talks involving US and Russian officials but would not be in the same room as the Russians. Zelenskyy is expected to present a list of facility types that could be subject to a partial ceasefire on energy targets. The Kremlin said Russian and US experts were also due to discuss ways to ensure the safety of shipping in the Black Sea at the talks in Saudi Arabia. Zelenskyy said on Saturday he had met top military commanders in Ukraine’s north-east to discuss the frontline as well as the upcoming talks with US officials. In social media images, Zelenskyy was seen in Kharkiv, a frequent target of Russian attacks. He said he discussed frontline sectors in Ukraine’s east as well as in western Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops remain seven months after a cross-border incursion. Authorities in southern Russia’s Krasnodar region brought in firefighting trains loaded with water on Saturday to help battle a blaze still raging at an oil depot after a Ukrainian drone attack. Regional officials said four trains were drafted into the site at Kavkazskaya, where the fire first broke out last Tuesday. Firefighters were tackling a fire still burning at one of the tanks at the site covering 1,250 square metres while also trying to cool other equipment at the site. On Friday, depressurisation of the burning tank triggered an explosion and the release of burning oil, Russian officials said."

The Zaporizhzhia regional governor, Ivan Fedorov, said on Telegram the city had been struck more than 10 times, killing two people and injuring nine. The injured included a nine-month-old infant and a woman in serious condition. Pictures posted online showed rescue teams sifting through rubble and apartment blocks and homes with windows and facades badly damaged. Fires burned amid piles of rubble. Two people were reported killed in the Sumy region, on Ukraine’s northern border with Russia, after Russian forces dropped at least six guided bombs on the village of Krasnopillia, while in the eastern Donetsk region, Russia dropped three bombs on the town of Kostiantynivka, close to the frontlines, killing one person. Germany on Friday approved €3bn (£2.5bn) in new military aid for Ukraine, including artillery munitions and air defence systems, government officials have said. The funds were released after months of delay and come on top of €4bn in Ukraine military aid already planned in the budget for 2025. Government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said the latest package would include units of the German-made Iris-T air defence systems that had yet to be built and would be delivered over the next two years. The UK is to “accelerate the pace and scale” of its military planning to be ready to support Ukraine, with No 10 saying all options, including troops on the ground, are possible. Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said thousands of troops would be needed to support Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire and agreement to end the war with Russia, whether by “sea, on land or in the air”. “Not all the countries in the coalition will have capabilities for Ukraine but might have the capability for other deployments, which would free up other nations to deploy to Ukraine,” the prime minister’s spokesperson said. The UK said on Friday it had frozen more than £25bn in Russian assets since the start of the war in Ukraine three years ago. In a report, the UK treasury also said it had sanctioned “2,001 individuals and entities” in the period between Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and March 2024. The economic secretary to the treasury, Emma Reynolds, said: “Working with our allies, we have deprived [Russia] of over $400bn the equivalent to four years of Russia’s military spending.” A Soviet-era dissident has been sentenced to 16 years in prison in Russia for his anti-war views. Alexander Skobov, 67, was sentenced on Friday over a social media post supporting Ukraine’s 2022 strike on the Crimea Bridge, as well as his alleged involvement with the foreign-based opposition group the Free Russia Forum. In a final statement before sentencing, Skobov accused the Putin regime of “waging an aggressive war [and] of committing war crimes in Ukraine”. Ukraine accused Russia on Friday of illegally pressuring Ukrainians in occupied territory to change their legal status or leave, and said it would report the practice to the international criminal court. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, issued a decree on Thursday saying Ukrainian citizens living “in Russia without legal grounds” should “regulate” their status by 10 September. Heorhii Tykhyi, a Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman, said Russia was conducting the “forced displacement of Ukrainian citizens from their homeland, or forcing them to acquire foreigner status”. Putin’s decree affects Ukrainians who live in the Crimean peninsula, as well as occupied parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, expressed his unwavering support for Russia’s war in Ukraine during a meeting with Russia’s security council secretary, Sergei Shoigu, in Pyongyang on Friday. North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Kim during the meeting said his government would “invariably support Russia in the struggle for defending the national sovereignty, territorial integrity and security interests”. Shoigu expressed gratitude for North Korea’s “solidarity with Russia’s position on all critical geopolitical issues, particularly on the Ukrainian issue,” according to his televised comments."

Speaking at the G20 meeting in Johannesburg, Wang Yi did not reiterate a point he made a week earlier at a meeting in Munich, that Ukraine must be involved in any further peace talks. “China supports all efforts conducive to peace [in Ukraine], including the recent consensus reached between the United States and Russia,” Wang said, according to a statement from his ministry. “China is willing to continue playing a constructive role in the political resolution of the crisis,” he added. Wang met Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the G20, and said relations between their two countries were “moving towards a higher level and broader dimension”. Both men will meet in Moscow soon for their next talks, Lavrov said earlier. Elon Musk launched a tirade against Volodymyr Zelenskyy, claiming the Ukrainian president is “despised by the people of Ukraine” and would lose an election if the country held one. The tech tycoon made his comments on X, which he owns, as he defended US president Donald Trump’s decision to sideline Ukraine from US-Russia talks aimed at ending the war. Musk also repeated Trump’s false claim that Zelenskyy has low approval ratings in his country. In fact, the most recent poll available shows Zelenskyy at 57% – an extremely high approval rating when set against his peers across Europe. In the same post, Musk also vowed to “fix” the Community Notes feature on X that allows users to fact-check potentially misleading posts, after the platform was flooded with people – including European officials and journalists – defending Ukraine and Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy said his meeting with the US special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, “restores hope”. After the talks, Zelenskyy said he was ready to work quickly to produce a strong agreement on investments and security with the US. It comes after the Ukrainian president exchanged insults with Trump. The Ukrainian president had said Trump was “trapped” in a “Russian “disinformation bubble” and echoing the Kremlin’s talking points on the war. Trump called Zelenskyy a “dictator”. White House officials told Ukraine to stop badmouthing Trump and sign a deal handing over $500bn worth of natural resources – half the country’s mineral wealth – to the US to repay it for wartime aid. The US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told reporters that Trump was “obviously very frustrated with Zelenskyy” for not accepting the deal. The Trump administration could adjust its sanctions against Russia in response to potential peace talks on Ukraine, the US treasury secretary told Bloomberg. Scott Bessent also joined the growing chorus of US voices criticising Zelenskyy for his criticism of Trump, saying that “he unfortunately escalated” and “put some daylight” between Ukraine and US. The upheaval in Washington’s Ukraine policy has triggered a flurry of diplomatic activity. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is scheduled to visit the White House on Monday, and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, is to visit on Thursday. The UK foreign secretary warned the west should not be “fooled” by Vladimir Putin’s attempts to dress up imperialism as pragmatism ahead of any further talks on the war. Speaking at the G20 in Johannesburg, David Lammy said: “If Putin is serious about a lasting peace, it means finding a way forward which respects Ukraine’s sovereignty and the UN charter, which provides credible security guarantees, and which rejects tsarist imperialism, and Britain is ready to listen. But we expect to hear more than the Russian gentleman’s tired fabrications.” The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, assured Zelenskyy in a call that any talks to end the war with Russia must include Kyiv. Trudeau reiterated Canada’s support for Ukraine and “emphasised that there can be no sustainable peace in Europe without security for Ukraine,” according to a statement from Trudeau’s office. In Greece, the prime minister has highlighted the need for Europe to augment its defence capabilities. Kyriakos Mitsotakis told Bloomberg TV: “This is really the time when we need to move more from words to actions.” The centre-right leader has long advocated that the continent spend more on defence. Former Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin has warned that Putin’s Russia will not stop at Ukraine if it is allowed to continue its aggression and could attack other neighbours and eventually Nato allies. Speaking in London, she warned that “the world seems very dangerous” now as she called for further support for Ukraine."
world/2025/may/24/ukraine-war-briefing-multiple-injuries-as-russia-attacks-kyiv-with-drones-and-missiles,Ukraine war briefing: Multiple injuries as Russia attacks Kyiv with drones and missiles,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/24/ukraine-war-briefing-multiple-injuries-as-russia-attacks-kyiv-with-drones-and-missiles,Ukraine war briefing: Multiple injuries as Russia attacks Kyiv with drones and missiles,"Kyiv came under heavy drone and missile attack by Russian forces overnight into Saturday, triggering fires and injuring at least 14 people, Ukrainian authorities said. Explosions and machine-gun fire were heard throughout the capital and many residents took shelter in underground subway stations. Debris fell in at least four districts, the Kyiv military administration said, calling the combined attack one of the biggest to date on the city. The Ukrainian air force said Russia launched 250 long-range drones and 14 ballistic missiles at Ukraine overnight, with Kyiv the main target. Pictures posted online showed smoke billowing from the top of one block of flats in Kyiv and flames leaping from part of another as emergency crews trained water on it. Russia and Ukraine on Friday began a major, complicated exchange of military prisoners of war and civilians, write Peter Beaumont and Pjotr Sauer. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, said the first phase brought home 390 Ukrainians, with further releases expected over the weekend. Russia’s defence ministry said it received the same number from Ukraine. Ukraine should focus on fighting a “hi-tech war of survival” that minimises losses of its personnel and not expect to recapture Russian-occupied territory, according to Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former head of Ukraine’s armed forces. Zaluzhnyi, who is the Ukrainian ambassador to the UK, said Ukraine should be “using a minimum of economic means to achieve maximum benefit … Ukraine is not capable of another war in terms of demography and economy, and we shouldn’t even entertain the thought.” Peter Beaumont reports that Ukraine’s military has announce the expansion of a “drone wall” or “drone line” to counter Russian forces. A €150bn (£126bn/$170bn) loans programme to rearm Europe was finalised this week. Member states can request EU-backed loans under the €150bn security action for Europe (Safe) scheme, which was approved on Wednesday. It is part of an €800bn rearmament plan drawn up after Donald Trump interrupted US military aid to Ukraine. Once the loans agreement is rubber-stamped next week, EU member states have six months to draw up plans for defence projects. “Member states will take those loans …. and will use them for joint procurement together with Ukraine and for Ukrainian needs,” Andrius Kubilius, the EU’s defence commissioner, told the Guardian’s Jennifer Rankin. Russia’s foreign minister said it would send Ukraine its terms for a peace settlement once their prisoner swap was complete. Sergei Lavrov didn’t say what those terms would be and the Kremlin has shown no sign of walking back its maximalist demands. Ukraine’s military general staff said it hit a Russian battery-manufacturing facility in the Lipetsk region which it said supplied Russia’s missile and bomb manufacturers. It struck the Energiya plant in the city of Yelets, it said on Telegram on Friday. “The shutdown of Energiya may leave some of the Russian occupiers’ military equipment and weapons without critical batteries.” A Russian military court in the western city of Ryazan has jailed a Russian-Italian man for 29 years after finding him guilty of terrorism-related charges and blowing up a freight train in 2023 at Ukraine’s behest, Russian state media reported. The RIA news agency cited Ruslan Sidiki’s lawyer as saying his client had partially admitted his guilt. Russian-language news outlets have in the past reported that Sidiki admitted his actions but denied intent to harm anyone or acting on anyone else’s orders. He viewed his actions as sabotage rather than terrorism and himself as a prisoner of war, those reports said."
world/2025/oct/20/ukraine-war-briefing-energy-war-continues-with-strikes-on-russian-oil-and-gas-plants,Ukraine war briefing: Energy war continues with strikes on Russian oil and gas plants,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/20/ukraine-war-briefing-energy-war-continues-with-strikes-on-russian-oil-and-gas-plants,Ukraine war briefing: Energy war continues with strikes on Russian oil and gas plants,"Ukrainian drones struck the giant Orenburg gas processing plant in southern Russia, sparking a fire and forcing it to suspend its intake of gas from Kazakhstan, according to both Russian and Kazakh authorities. The plant is run by Russia’s state-owned Gazprom company and located in a region of the same name near the Kazakh border. It is part of a production and processing complex that is one of the world’s largest of its kind with an annual capacity of 45bn cubic metres. It handles gas condensate from Kazakhstan’s Karachaganak field as well as Orenburg’s own oil and gas fields. The Russian regional governor, Yevgeny Solntsev, said drone strikes set fire to a workshop at the plant and damaged part of it. The Kazakh energy ministry on Sunday said Gazprom had notified it that the plant was temporarily unable to process gas originating in Kazakhstan “due to an emergency situation following a drone attack”. Ukraine’s general staff said a “large-scale fire” erupted at the plant and one of its gas processing and purification units was damaged. A separate drone strike hit Russia’s Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery, in the Samara region near Orenburg, sparking a blaze and damaging its main refining units, Ukraine’s general staff said. It is operated by Rosneft and has an annual capacity of 4.9m tonnes, turning out more than 20 kinds of petroleum products. Russian forces meanwhile attacked a coalmine in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region and an energy site in the Chernihiv region, their operators said. Energy firm DTEK said 192 coalminers were safely brought to the surface with no injuries; while Chernihivoblenergo, the regional energy company in Chernihiv, said an attack there caused extensive damage and cut off electricity to 55,000 users. Russian attacks in recent weeks have focused on Ukraine’s civilian power grid and energy sites, while Ukraine has attacked Russian oil and gas facilities that either directly power the war or help fund it through exports. A sanctioned “shadow fleet” tanker was preparing to transfer Russian liquefied natural gas to another ship off the coast of Malaysia, the Bloomberg news agency reported. Satellite tracking showed the “dark ship” Perle lying next to another ship about 90km east of the Malaysian peninsula, Bloomberg said, reporting: “Bloomberg analysis suggests that this could be the first documented occurrence of Russian LNG transferred in waters off Malaysia.” The gas appeared to have been loaded at Russia’s Portovaya plant on the Baltic coast, the agency said. The European Union wants “flag states” that register ships to pre-authorise the stopping and inspection of Russia’s “shadow fleet” of illicit oil tankers. The EU’s diplomatic arm, the EEAS, said estimates had put the shadow fleet at anywhere between 600 and 1,400 ships, with the EU sanctioning more than 400 as well as entities that enable the fleet to operate. Once the EU adopts its 19th package of sanctions – likely within the next week – that figure will rise to about 560 vessels and bring forward a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports by a year to 1 January 2027. The number of shadow fleet ships sailing under a false flag has recently increased, according to the EEAS. Beefing up inspections is the latest EU proposal aimed at curbing Russian oil and gas revenue being used by Moscow to finance the Ukraine war. EU foreign ministers are due to meet on Monday to discuss this and other new measures against Russia. The G7 has agreed to work jointly towards curbing the shadow fleet and to target countries that help Moscow circumvent sanctions as well as those that have increased Russian oil imports. The EU said its measures would also target tanker refuelling. Donald Trump again changed his tune on the war, this time reportedly putting pressure on Volodymy Zelenskyy to surrender territory to Vladimir Putin. The US president said less than a month ago that he thought Ukraine could take back all its territory and even “go further” into Russian lands. Now, after a phone call from Putin, Trump is also backpedalling from talk of supplying Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. The US president has repeatedly appeared to be readily manipulated by Putin. The Financial Times reported that Trump warned Zelenskyy that Putin would “destroy” Ukraine unless a peace deal was made. “It was pretty bad,” a source said after Trump’s meeting with Zelenskyy. “The message was ‘Your country will freeze, and your country will be destroyed’ [if Ukraine doesn’t make a deal with Russia].” A separate source denied that Trump said “destroyed” but both sources said Trump resorted to profanity several times. Ukrainian strikes killed two people and wounded one in Russia’s Belgorod region “when a drone dropped explosives on an agricultural enterprise”, said the local governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov. Moscow has stepped up direct attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, while Ukraine’s military denies deliberately targeting civilians."
world/2025/sep/26/ukraine-war-briefing-un-watchdog-sounds-warning-after-drone-detonates-near-ukraine-nuclear-plant,Ukraine war briefing: UN watchdog sounds warning after drone detonates near Ukraine nuclear plant ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/26/ukraine-war-briefing-un-watchdog-sounds-warning-after-drone-detonates-near-ukraine-nuclear-plant,Ukraine war briefing: UN watchdog sounds warning after drone detonates near Ukraine nuclear plant ,"A drone was downed and detonated about 800 metres (875 yards) from the perimeter of a Ukrainian nuclear power plant, the UN atomic watchdog said on Thursday, with its head warning that “once again drones are flying far too close to nuclear power plants, putting nuclear safety at risk”. The agency said its monitors at the site were informed that 22 drones were observed in the South Ukraine plant’s monitoring zone late on Wednesday and early on Thursday, with some drones flying as close as 500 metres. Monitors heard gunfire and explosions about 1am and later visited the site, near the city of Pivdennoukrainsk, in Mykolaiv region, where the drone came down and saw a crater about 4 sq metres, said a statement from the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi. “Nearby metal structures had been hit by shrapnel and the windows of vehicles close to the impact area were shattered,” he said. “A power line also came down, though it was not connected to the plant … Fortunately, last night’s incident did not result in any damage to the South Ukraine nuclear power plant itself. Next time we may not be so lucky.” There were no reports of casualties. The IAEA also said the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia station had been without power for more than 48 hours after external power lines supplying the plant came down for the 10th time in the conflict. The lines supply electricity vital to cooling its reactors’ fuel and preventing a meltdown. Emergency diesel generators were in operation. Russia is responsible for “widespread and systematic violations” of international law in the treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war including “arbitrary killings”, according to a report from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The violations also include “torture, ill-treatment, denial of fair trial rights and unsafe detention and transfer conditions”, it said. The Vienna-based OSCE’s report, published on Thursday, is the result of a mission of three experts tasked to look into Russia’s treatment of Ukrainian PoWs. They found that Ukrainian soldiers were not recognised as prisoners of war by Russia, which “opens the door for criminal prosecution of PoWs for mere participation in hostilities”. “The mission documented a high number of arbitrary killings and executions attributable to the Russian Federation, occurring both on the battlefield and in detention,” the report said. Russia’s foreign minister has accused Nato and the European Union of using Ukraine to declare a “real war” against his country in a speech at the United Nations that the UK dismissed as “false fantasy world distortions”. Sergei Lavrov’s comments at a G20 meeting of foreign ministers on Thursday came two days after US president Donald Trump signalled a harsher stance on Moscow, praising Ukraine’s war effort and saying Nato allies should shoot down Russian jets that enter their airspace. Lavrov spoke of “the crisis in Ukraine provoked by the west, through which Nato and the EU have ... already declared a real war on my country and are directly involved in it”, while making no reference to Trump’s comments. British foreign secretary Yvette Cooper called out Lavrov as he went to leave when she began her speech and condemned Russia’s “unprovoked war of aggression” against Ukraine, saying: “No amount of false fantasy world distortions, misinformation and propaganda from the Russian representative about the causes of the war will convince anyone.” The US has announced the approval of a $1.23bn sale of up to 400 advanced air-to-air missiles and related equipment to Nato ally Germany. The proposed sale “will improve Germany’s capability to meet current and future threats”, the US Defence Security Cooperation Agency said. The move on Thursday came after German chancellor Friedrich Merz vowed to take “all necessary measures to ensure effective deterrence against ... violations of airspace and other attacks by the Russian military”. Recent weeks have seen Russia send fighter jets and drones into the airspace of Nato members Poland and Romania, followed by suspicious drone flights near airports in Denmark and Norway. Merz’s government has also blamed Moscow for multiple drone sightings over German military and industrial sites. Russian attacks on Thursday temporarily knocked out power to at least 70,000 people in Ukraine’s northern Chernihiv region, officials said, amid renewed Russian airstrikes on shattered energy infrastructure ahead of winter. About 29,000 consumers faced power cuts in Chernihiv and the surrounding district, as well as 43,000 in the town of Nizhyn, the regional power distribution operator said on Telegram. Works to restore electricity supplies were under way. Russian troops also targeted energy facilities in Vinnytsia, disrupting power flows for parts of the central city and causing fires. German chancellor Friedrich Merz is advocating for the European Union to unlock up to €140bn ($164bn) in frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine’s war effort, marking the first public expression of support at this level from Germany for such a move. The proposal of an interest-free EU loan, outlined in the Financial Times, aims to provide long-term support for Ukraine without violating property rights. The assets would remain frozen until Russia pays reparations for the war, Merz suggested, addressing longstanding legal and financial concerns that had previously made Germany and other EU states wary of confiscating Russian assets. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy outlined Ukraine’s plans to boost drone exports and expand tech partnerships as he met the top management of a host of leading US businesses including Amazon, Bank of America and Westinghouse, his office said on Thursday. “Our country has a strong drone manufacturing industry and more than 300 technology companies,” the Ukrainian president said in a statement. “I think this is a new direction for our business and economy in the future. I think this year we will open up exports of our new technologies only to those countries that we can count on.” Zelenskyy has said he will be ready to leave office once the war is over, Axios has reported. The president, responding to Trump administration criticism over the indefinite suspension of elections in wartime Ukraine, told the US website that he would not seek to remain in power once peace came. “My goal is to finish the war,” not to continue to run for office, he said. He also warned that the Kremlin would become a target and Russian officials should check for bomb shelters if Moscow did not stop its invasion."
world/2025/jun/27/ukraine-war-briefing-soldiers-captured-by-russia-in-mariupol-among-those-released-in-prisoner-swap,Ukraine war briefing: Soldiers captured by Russia in Mariupol among those released in prisoner swap,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/27/ukraine-war-briefing-soldiers-captured-by-russia-in-mariupol-among-those-released-in-prisoner-swap,Ukraine war briefing: Soldiers captured by Russia in Mariupol among those released in prisoner swap,"Ukraine and Russia exchanged a new group of captured soldiers on Thursday, the latest in a series of prisoner swaps agreed at peace talks in Istanbul earlier this month. Neither side said how many prisoners were released in the latest exchange. The majority had been held captive for more than three years, according to Ukraine’s coordination headquarters for the treatment of prisoners of war. Many of them were taken prisoner in Mariupol, a Ukrainian port city that fell to Russian forces in 2022 after a nearly three-month siege, it said. Russian officials said its soldiers had been transferred to Belarus and were receiving “psychological and medical care”. The EU’s 27 leaders on Thursday agreed to extend sanctions on Russia for another six months, resolving fears that Kremlin-friendly Hungary would let the measures lapse, officials said. The decision at a summit in Brussels means that the EU’s sweeping sanctions over the war in Ukraine, including the freezing of more than 200bn euros ($234bn) in Russian central bank assets, will remain in force until at least early 2026. But while the EU made sure its existing measures will remain in place, it failed to get clearance on a new package of sanctions due to a blockage by Slovakia. The leaders also said the bloc “remains steadfast in its support for Ukraine’s path towards EU membership.” That message came a day after Nato leaders refrained from putting a reference to Ukraine’s hopes of joining the military organisation in their summit statement, due in large part to US resistance. In a video message sent to EU leaders, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged them to send “a clear political message – that Ukraine is firmly on the European path and that Europe stands by its promises.” Traffic on the Don River in the Kalachevsky district of Russia’s Volgograd region was temporarily restricted to eliminate wreckage from a “massive” Ukrainian drone attack, the regional governor’s administration said early on Friday. “Sappers are at work,” Volgograd Governor Andrei Bocharov was cited as saying in a post on the Telegram messaging app by the region’s administration. It was not immediately clear whether the bridge on the Don River, Europe’s fifth-longest, was damaged. The White House has recommended terminating US funding for nearly two dozen programs that conduct war crimes and accountability work globally, including on alleged Russian atrocities in Ukraine, according to two US sources familiar with the matter and internal government documents reviewed by Reuters. The recommendation from the Office of Management and Budget, which has not been previously reported, is not the final decision to end the programs since it gives the state department the option to appeal. Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said Thursday that a new arms race could lead to the fall of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “regime”, just like it toppled the Soviet Union. The Nato member’s top diplomat spoke after the western defence alliance agreed to massively ramp up defence spending, seen as vital to counter the threat from Russia. “Putin should understand that he is on the path of [Soviet leader Leonid] Brezhnev. He himself once said that the Soviet Union collapsed because it spent too much on armament, and now he is doing exactly the same thing,” Sikorski said in an interview with AFP, the Polish news agency PAP and German agency DPA. Ukrainian forces have halted Russia’s recent advance into the northern Sumy region and have stabilized the frontline near the border with Russia, Ukraine’s top military commander said on Thursday. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, said that Ukrainian successes in Sumy have prevented Russia from deploying about 50,000 Russian troops, including elite airborne and marine brigades, to other areas of the frontline. Russian troops have taken control of a village in eastern Ukraine which is close to a lithium deposit after fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces, a Russian-backed official said on Thursday. The village of Shevchenko is located in Donetsk. The Russian defence ministry announced earlier on Thursday that Shevchenko had been taken along with another settlement called Novoserhiivka. The international chemical weapons watchdog said Thursday that it had found a banned teargas in seven samples submitted by Ukraine, which has accused Russia of using the riot control agent on the frontline. It was the third time the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has confirmed the use of CS gas in areas where fighting is taking place in Ukraine."
world/2025/mar/27/ukraine-war-briefing-russia-desires-war-while-ukrainians-take-risk-of-peace-says-macron,"Ukraine war briefing: Russia desires war while Ukrainians ‘take risk of peace’, says Macron",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/27/ukraine-war-briefing-russia-desires-war-while-ukrainians-take-risk-of-peace-says-macron,"Ukraine war briefing: Russia desires war while Ukrainians ‘take risk of peace’, says Macron","Emmanuel Macron has warned that Russia still shows a “desire for war” despite efforts towards a ceasefire as European leaders including Volodymyr Zelenskyy meet in Paris on Thursday to discuss how Europe might offer Kyiv security guarantees in the event of a lasting truce. Macron said Russia had tried to impose “new conditions” and not responded to a 30-day general ceasefire offered by Ukraine “without preconditions”. He praised Kyiv for having “taken the risk of peace”. Thursday’s gathering brings together leaders from the so-called “coalition of the willing” – a British-French-led group of countries considering deploying peacekeeping troops to Ukraine should a ceasefire be reached. Macron on Wednesday announced a new French €2bn ($2.15bn) military aid package for Ukraine, with Paris ready to rapidly ship existing hardware from its stocks. There remained no clearly defined or mutually agreed ceasefire covering any aspect of the Russia-Ukraine war. Russia said that only in return for the lifting of a raft of sanctions and access to the Swift international banking system would it implement a ceasefire covering Black Sea shipping. The US said it would consider the sanctions request, while the EU suggested it would only lift sanctions in response to “the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces” from Ukraine. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said examining Russia’s asks and reaching a deal “won’t be simple, it’ll take some time, but at least we’re on that road and we’re talking about these things”. Russia claimed to be observing a month-long moratorium declared by Vladimir Putin on strikes against Ukrainian energy targets; however, Russian drone and missile strikes have continued to cause blackouts and, according to Ukraine, energy sites have been hit. Despite there being no actual ceasefire, Russia has accused Ukraine of committing breaches, including by targeting gas storage in Crimea – actually Ukrainian territory – which Ukraine denied; while Zelenskyy says Russia has proven by its continued attacks on Ukraine that it does not truly want peace. Four people were reported killed and six injured across Ukraine overnight into Wednesday, writes Pjotr Sauer, while the Ukrainian air force said it shot down 56 of 117 incoming drones and another 48 were decoys that caused no damage. Late on Wednesday, Russian forces launched a mass drone attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, injuring nine people, causing considerable damage and starting four fires in the city centre, officials said. The Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said there had been at least 12 drone strikes. A drone attack also triggered fires in the central city of Dnipro, said the regional governor, Serhiy Lysak. North Korea has sent 3,000 more troops to Russia so far this year and continues to supply missiles, artillery and ammunition, according to South Korea’s military joint chiefs of staff. Of the initial 11,000 soldiers sent in 2024, 4,000 were believed to have been killed or wounded. The US-Ukraine critical minerals deal was mentioned again as the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told Fox News that “a completed document for the economic partnership is currently being reviewed by Ukrainians, and we hope to go to full discussions and perhaps even get signatures next week”. A week ago, the White House said it had “moved beyond” that deal to focus on peace efforts – only for Trump, the US president, to reverse that a day later by saying it would be signed “very shortly”. Relations between Kyiv and Washington were “back on track”, said Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukraine’s president. He told Reuters that after the fraught Oval Office encounter last month, two rounds of talks in Saudi Arabia on a potential ceasefire had given Kyiv an opportunity to show it could work with US officials on ending the war. Russia convicted 23 captured Ukrainians on terrorism charges in a military trial that Kyiv denounced as a sham and a violation of international law. The defendants included 14 current or former fighters of the Azov brigade, and nine women and one man who worked as cooks or support personnel, according to Russian media reports and human rights defenders. They were given sentences ranging from 13 to 23 years in prison. Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, called the verdicts “illegal”, adding: “Ukrainian prisoners of war are combatants, not criminals! They were fulfilling their duty to the state, protecting its territorial integrity and sovereignty.” Last year brought Ukraine’s worst wildfires in more than three decades as shelling along front lines triggered an unprecedented number of blazes, scientists said. Forest fires in Ukraine in 2024 burnt more than twice the area destroyed by fire in the entire 27-country European Union in 2024, said an EU report."

The sanctions list, which also includes Russian companies, names Beijing Aviation &amp; Aerospace Xianghui Technology, Rui Jin Machinery and Zhongfu Shenying Carbon Fiber Xining, all registered in China. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on X: “Today, we have expanded our Ukrainian sanctions against nearly a hundred more entities – natural and legal persons – most of whom are involved in the production of such missiles – Iskanders – like those that struck our Kharkiv. Many of these entities are Russian, but unfortunately, some are also from China.” On Thursday, Zelenskyy accused China of supplying Russia with artillery and gunpowder, which Beijing has denied. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the Trump administration was ready to abandon its efforts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia “within days”. “We’re not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end. So we need to determine very quickly now, and I’m talking about a matter of days, whether or not this is doable in the next few weeks,” Rubio said in Paris after meeting European and Ukrainian leaders on Friday. Following Rubio’s comments, Donald Trump said the US is ready to “pass” on brokering a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine unless a settlement is reached “very shortly”. The US president declined to give a “specific number of days” for when the US would stop trying to negotiate a truce. “But quickly. We want to get it done.” Asked if the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was stalling, Trump replied: “I hope not.” The Guardian has obtained the memorandum of intent signed by Ukraine and the US over a minerals deal. It envisages setting up a joint investment fund between the two countries and lays out a deadline of 26 April to finalise negotiations. The document recognises the “significant financial and material support” Washington has given Kyiv since Russia’s full-scale 2022 invasion. The US is prepared to recognise Russian control of the Ukrainian region of Crimea as part of a broader peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv, Bloomberg News has reported, citing people familiar with the matter. According to Bloomberg, the people said a final decision on the matter hadn’t yet been taken, and the White House and state department did not respond to a request for comment. A Russian missile attack on the north-eastern city of Kharkiv killed one man inside his home and wounded at least 112 others, including nine children, on Friday. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Russia launched four missiles at Kharkiv, three of them ballistic and carrying cluster warheads. Zelenskyy added later that the Iskander missiles had been used in the attack. “This is how Russia began this Good Friday – with ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, Shaheds,” he said on X. A Russian drone strike early on Friday hit a bakery in northern Ukraine where traditional Easter cakes were being prepared, killing one man, Ukrainian officials said. Images shared by Ukrainian emergency services – which said they were filmed at the scene of the strike in the city of Sumy – showed trays of Easter cakes covered in grey dust, and a smashed window nearby. The person killed was a local businessman who was at the bakery to collect his order when the drone struck at 5am, according to Sybiha. Russia and Ukraine will conduct a new prisoner swap on Saturday mediated by the United Arab Emirates, a source close to the negotiations told Reuters. Nearly 500 Russian and Ukrainian prisoners and 46 injured soldiers will be exchanged in the latest swap to be mediated by Abu Dhabi. The exchange will involve 246 prisoners from each side, the source said. Kyiv said on Friday it had received the bodies of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers killed during battles with Russia, the second such repatriation in the space of three weeks. “As a result of repatriation activities, the bodies of 909 fallen Ukrainian defenders were returned to Ukraine,” the Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War, a government agency, said in a statement on social media. A 19-year-old Russian activist has been sentenced to two years and eight months in prison after using 19th-century poetry and graffiti to protest against the conflict in Ukraine, according to a Reuters witness in the St Petersburg court on Friday. Darya Kozyreva was found guilty of repeatedly “discrediting” the Russian army after she put up a poster with lines of Ukrainian verse on a public square and gave an interview to Sever.Realii, a Russian-language service of Radio Free Europe."
world/2025/nov/15/ukraine-war-briefing-mass-production-of-ukrainian-octopus-interceptor-drones-begins,Ukraine war briefing: mass production of Ukrainian ‘Octopus’ interceptor drones begins,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/15/ukraine-war-briefing-mass-production-of-ukrainian-octopus-interceptor-drones-begins,Ukraine war briefing: mass production of Ukrainian ‘Octopus’ interceptor drones begins,"Ukraine says it has started mass production of its new domestically developed interceptor drones to strengthen air defences. The first three manufacturers had begun production and 11 more were preparing to set up production lines, the defence ministry said on Friday. The drones would be based on a domestically developed technology called “Octopus” to intercept Shahed drones. It had been tested in combat and proved to be working “at night, under jamming and at low altitudes”, the ministry said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the goal is to manufacture up to 1,000 of the interceptors a day. Russia has been steadily increasing the number of drones it uses in a single strike on Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has described Russia’s latest attack against Ukraine as “deliberate, calculated and wicked” after six people were killed and dozens injured in a wave of night-time strikes across Kyiv, reports Luke Harding. Air raid sirens sounded in the capital shortly after midnight on Friday and Shahed drones could soon be heard in the sky, with heavy machine-gun fire from Ukrainian air defences. Zelenskyy said the country was hit by 430 drones and 18 missiles. The dead had been at home in a block of flats on Kyiv’s left bank when it was hit. Dozens of other buildings were damaged, including the Azerbaijani embassy. Azerbaijan said it issued a strong protest to the Russian ambassador on Friday after the embassy damage. The blast from a Russian Iskander missile destroyed part of the embassy’s perimeter wall and caused serious damage to the diplomatic compound, the Azerbaijani foreign ministry said. No one was hurt, and a ministry spokesperson said the Kyiv embassy was continuing to operate. Russia plans to manufacture up to 120,000 glide bombs this year, a senior Ukrainian intelligence official said, including 500 of a new, longer-range version that can reach more towns and cities. Reuters was unable to verify Ukraine’s claims, disclosed by defence intelligence’s deputy head, Maj Gen Vadym Skibitskyi, but it would indicate a vast increase in the manufacture of the cheap and devastating glide bombs, which use wings – and sometimes engines – to fly dozens of kilometres to their targets. Skibitskyi said Russian forces were firing 200 to 250 glide bombs a day. Last month’s daily average was about 170, according to defence ministry data. Russia’s Black Sea port of Novorossiysk temporarily suspended oil exports on Friday – equivalent to 2% of global supply – after a Ukrainian missile and drone attack, Reuters reported industry sources as saying. Ukraine’s general staff said its forces had fired Neptune cruise missiles and used various types of strike drones in the attack on Novorossiysk “as part of efforts to reduce the military and economic potential of the Russian aggressor”. Ukraine said it separately struck an oil refinery in Russia’s Saratov region and a fuel storage facility in nearby Engels overnight. Russia’s second-largest oil producer Lukoil said on Friday it has been in talks with potential buyers of its foreign assets after last month’s sanctions from the UK and the US as a deal with the Gunvor trading house collapsed. “The specific deal will be announced after the final agreements have been reached and the necessary regulatory approvals have been obtained,” Lukoil said. Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit the Spanish capital, Madrid, on Tuesday to meet with lawmakers a day after his visit to Paris, the chamber of deputies announced. The Ukrainian president would meet deputies from both chambers of parliament during his visit, the Spanish statement said."
world/2025/jan/12/ukraine-war-briefing-ukraine-captures-two-north-korean-soldiers-in-russia,Ukraine war briefing: Ukraine ‘captures two North Korean soldiers in Russia’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/12/ukraine-war-briefing-ukraine-captures-two-north-korean-soldiers-in-russia,Ukraine war briefing: Ukraine ‘captures two North Korean soldiers in Russia’,"Ukraine said it was interrogating two North Korean soldiers after capturing the pair in Russia’s Kursk region – the first time it has announced the capture of North Korean soldiers alive since their entry into the war last year. The president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on X on Saturday the soldiers were captured by Ukraine’s special forces and were being interrogated by the SBU domestic intelligence agency in Kyiv. The SBU released a video showing the two men in hospital bunks, one with bandaged hands and the other with a bandaged jaw. It said their questioning was being done in Korean with the help of South Korea’s NIS intelligence agency. Neither Russia nor North Korea immediately reacted to the announcement. The SBU said the two captured North Korean men had told interrogators they were experienced soldiers, and one said he was sent to Russia for training, not to fight. It said one PoW carried a Russian military ID card “issued in the name of another person” while the other had no documents. The SBU showed an ID issued to a 26-year-old man from Russia’s Tyva region bordering Mongolia. The SBU added that he was a rifleman born in 2005 and had been in the North Korean army since 2021. The other man, who wrote his answers because of his injured jaw, said he was born in 1999, had joined the army in 2016 and was a scout sniper, the SBU said. South Korea’s intelligence agency on Sunday backed up Ukraine’s account of having captured the soldiers. The NIS said it had “confirmed that the Ukrainian military captured two North Korean soldiers on 9 January in the Kursk battlefield in Russia”. It similarly said one of the captured soldiers revealed during his interrogation that he received military training from Russia after arriving there in November. The soldier said North Korean forces had experienced “significant losses during battle”, NIS said. According to the NIS, one of the men “went without food or water for four to five days before being captured”. Zelensyy said it was difficult to capture North Koreans alive because “Russians and other North Korean soldiers finish off their wounded” to cover up “evidence of the participation of another state, North Korea, in the war”. He said he would provide media access to the prisoners of war because “the world needs to know what is happening”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga, wrote online: “We need maximum pressure against regimes in Moscow and Pyongyang.” Russia said its army had gained control of a village near the eastern Ukrainian logistical centre of Pokrovsk, a key target in its advance through the Donetsk region. Ukraine’s military made no mention of the village of Shevchenko in its latest account of frontline activity, but said Russia had launched more than 50 attacks against its forces’ positions near Pokrovsk in the past 24 hours. The Russian military report said its troops launched strikes with aircraft, drones and missiles on Ukrainian military airfields and energy infrastructure that service its army. Ukraine’s general staff said its forces repelled 46 of 56 Russian attacks around about a dozen towns in the Pokrovsk sector. Ten clashes were continuing. The governor of the part of Donetsk region held by Ukrainian forces, Vadym Filashkin, said one resident was killed and four injured when a village north of Pokrovsk came under Russian shelling. Russia launched 74 drones at Ukraine overnight, Kyiv’s air force said early on Saturday, adding it had downed 47 of them, while 27 others disappeared from radar without reaching their targets. The air force said buildings and vehicles in seven different regions were damaged by falling debris from downed drones, but there were no casualties. Ukraine launched drone attacks across several regions of Russia, striking two houses in the Tambov region and injuring several people, Russia said on Saturday. Ukraine denies attacking civilian targets in Russia. The regional head, Evgeny Pervyshov, said on Telegram that people were treated for injures resulting from shattered windows as drones hit two houses in the town of Kotovsk, 480km (300 miles) south-east of Moscow. The Russian defence ministry said it intercepted and destroyed 85 Ukrainian drones overnight in several regions of the country, including 31 drones over the Black Sea, 16 each in the Voronezh and Krasnodar regions and 14 over the Azov Sea. Vladimir Putin awarded Russia’s highest honour for bravery on Saturday to Cpl Andrei Grigoryev after a widely posted video showed him killing a Ukrainian opponent in hand-to-hand combat. Ukrainian media identified the soldier killed as Dmytro Maslovsky from the southern Odesa region. • This article was amended on 12 January 2025 to replace the main image."

The US has highlighted China and India as contributors to the Russia-Ukraine war due to their ongoing purchases of oil from Moscow. Zelenskyy told the UN security council that China could pressure Russia to end the war in his country. China is not a party to the conflict, but Kyiv has long complained that Beijing has supplied items to Moscow that can be used in its war against Ukraine, and continues to purchase Russian energy. “If China truly wanted this war to stop, it could compel Moscow to end the invasion. Without China, Putin’s Russia is nothing.” Donald Trump has said he believes Ukraine can regain all the land that it has lost since the 2022 Russian invasion in one of the strongest statements of support he has given Kyiv. The US president delivered his upbeat assessment by claiming Russia was in big economic trouble in a post on Truth Social after meeting the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in New York. “Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia,” Trump said on Truth Social, adding that Putin and Russia were in “big economic trouble.” Zelenskyy welcomed Trump’s “big shift” on Russia. Russia is launching long-range drones into the airspace of Nato countries to probe the military alliance’s air defences and search for weak points, Zelenskyy said Tuesday. “He will try to find weak places in Europe, in Nato countries, he will try to do it,” Zelensky said at a press conference at the United Nations. Russian authorities have subjected civilian detainees in Ukrainian areas it occupies to “widespread” and “systematic” torture, including sexual violence, the United Nations said Tuesday. A UN rights office report concluded that Russia “has subjected Ukrainian civilian detainees to consistent patterns of serious violations” of international law since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine’s energy ministry called for decisive international action to secure the removal of occupying Russian forces from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, after all external power lines were cut off for the 10th time. “Today’s incident once again proves that the Russian occupation is the main threat to the safe operation of the Zaporizhzhia NPP,” the ministry said in a statement."

Putin made his customary false accusation that Zelenskyy is not Ukraine’s legitimate president. In a round-table interview in St Petersburg with international news agencies, Putin said on Nato: “We do not consider any Nato rearmament to be a threat to the Russian Federation, because we are self-sufficient in terms of ensuring our security.” Russia has brought in thousands of North Korean soldiers to help defend Kursk; and has relied on a flood of arms and ammunition from North Korea as well as Iranian drones and missiles to wage war on Ukraine; while also receiving suspected help from China to continue arming a “special military operation” that Putin thought would be over in three days. The potential collapse of the Iranian regime would be a serious blow to Putin, Russian affairs reporter Pjotr Sauer writes. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to attend the Nato summit in The Hague on 24-25 June, a source in the Ukrainian presidency told the AFP news agency on Wednesday. “The decision will be made on the eve of the summit. This is just the schedule,” the source said, describing the meeting as “an opportunity to maintain support and promote a ceasefire”. Nato leaders want to keep the summit brief so as not to aggravate Donald Trump and his short attention span, the Times has reported (£). Senior Ukrainian officials at the G7 summit in Canada discussed with US counterparts the possibility of supporting defence projects in Ukraine under a joint investment fund set up in May, Kyiv’s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said on Wednesday. The talks included the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, Svyrydenko said. The death toll from Tuesday’s Russian attack on Kyiv stood at 28, with more than 130 injured, as the recovery of bodies continued at destroyed apartment blocks. Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces hit a Ukrainian troop position in the Sumy region with an Iskander missile. The Reuters news agency said it could not independently confirm the battlefield report, or determine exactly when it took place. Ukrainian authorities on Monday reported an Iskander missile strike on Konotop damaged flats in multi-storey buildings with no casualties. Ukraine is trying to drive Russian forces from the Sumy region where border areas are gripped by heavy fighting. Slovak police have detained eight people, including defence ministry officials, in an investigation by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office into possible misuse of €7.4m for military aid to Ukraine at the start of the war in February 2022. Jaroslav Nad, who was Slovakia’s defence minister at the time, has called the police action “theatre”. Slovakia’s pro-Russia current prime minister, Robert Fico, has taken sharp policy turns since taking power in 2023 – stopping military aid to Ukraine and making a trip to Moscow that fuelled large and widespread protests in opposition to his stance on Ukraine."

A Russian drone attack on the central market in the Ukrainian town of Nikopol injured eight on Thursday morning, local authorities said. Seven of those injured were hospitalised after the strike damaged multiple stalls at the market. The Ukrainian military said that its air force had carried out a strike on a military industrial facility in Russia’s Rostov region over the past few days. The facility in the town of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky was used to produce solid fuel for ballistic missiles used in Russian attacks on Ukraine, The Ukrainian military said that it shot down 20 drones out of 31 launched by Russia overnight. Of the 31 drones, 11 “imitator-drones” did not reach their targets due to active engagement from the Ukrainian military, it added. Readiness to support Ukraine “until it wins” has fallen sharply across western Europe at a critical time for the country, a survey has suggested. December polling by YouGov in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark and the UK found support for an alternative resolution to the conflict – a negotiated end to the fighting, even if that left Russia in control of parts of Ukraine – is now the preferred option. Russia and Kazakhstan have sought to temper speculation about the cause of the Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash, with the Kremlin urging people to wait for the results of the investigation. Four sources with knowledge of the investigation told Reuters that a Russian air defence downed the plane. Russia’s top security agency said that it arrested several suspects accused of involvement in an alleged Ukrainian plot to assassinate senior military officers, an announcement that follows the killing of a top Russian general last week. The Russian defence ministry claimed that Russian forces have captured a village of Hihant in eastern Ukraine, the RIA news agency has reported. Reuters could not independently confirm battlefield reports from either side. Thanks for following the blog today. We’re closing it for now, but we’ll be back tomorrow to keep you in the loop. Finnish authorities have said that they are investigating an oil tanker that sailed from a Russian port for the “sabotage” of a power cable linking Finland and Estonia that was damaged the previous day. Reuters reports: On Christmas Day, the Estlink 2 submarine cable that carries electricity from Finland to Estonia was disconnected from the grid, just over a month after two telecommunications cables were severed in Swedish territorial waters in the Baltic Sea. Robin Lardot of Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation said a probe for “aggravated sabotage” had been opened into the oil tanker Eagle S, that flies under the flag of the Cook Islands in the South Pacific. Sami Rakshit from Director General of Finnish Customs said: The assumption at the moment is that it is a shadow fleet vessel and the cargo was unleaded petrol loaded in a Russian port. The shadow fleet refers to the ships which transport embargoed Russian crude and oil products. Prime Minister Petteri Orpo, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, posted on X: We monitored the situation closely yesterday. The risks posed by the Russian shadow fleet must be ruled out. The Eagle S is bound for Port Said in Egypt and still located in the Gulf of Finland, according to the Marine Traffic website. Police suspect that the oil tanker’s anchor might have damaged the power cable. Four sources with knowledge of the investigation have told Reuters that the Azerbaijan Airlines flight that crashed in Kazakhstan on Wednesday was downed by a Russian air defence system. An Embraer passenger jet crashed near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan on Wednesday, killing 38 people, after diverting from an area of Russia in which Moscow has used air defence systems against Ukrainian drone strikes in recent months. However Mangystau Regional Transport Prosecutor Abylaibek Ordabayev said the Kazakh investigation has not yet come to any conclusions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that France had tried to establish “dialogue” with Moscow on Ukraine but without Kyiv’s participation - a claim that was dismissed by Paris. AFP reports: Western countries have called for a united front in support for Ukraine and have constantly said that no decisions could be taken without Ukraine’s agreement. Lavrov said at a press conference: On several occasions our French colleagues have appealed through confidential channels: ’Let us help, let’s have a dialogue on the Ukrainian question’. Without Ukraine. He said Russian officials were “ready to listen”. Lavrov did not say when these appeals might have happened or reveal any more details about the supposed contact. A French diplomatic source told AFP: The Russian authorities are accustomed to making intemperate remarks aimed at exploiting a war of aggression for which they bear full responsibility. As France has reiterated since the beginning of the war, it is up to Ukraine, the aggressed country, to define the time and conditions under which they wish to enter into a negotiation process. Russia’s aviation watchdog has said that all four Moscow airports and the airport in Kaluga, 160km (100 miles) southwest of Moscow, have just been closed temporarily, without giving the reason. The Rosaviatsia statement said: Aircraft crews, air traffic controllers and airport services are taking all necessary measures to ensure flight safety. Estonia’s government was to hold an extraordinary meeting on Thursday as investigators try to find out what disrupted a Baltic Sea power cable bringing electricity from Finland, Estonia’s prime minister said Thursday. The Estlink-2 power went down just after noon on Wednesday. Officials have been on edge about undersea cables in the wake of damage to two data cables in November and Nord Stream gas pipeline, both of which have been termed sabotage. “Despite holidays, many people in Estonia and Finland have been working for the last two days to identify the problem for the Estlink-2 disconnection,” prime minister Kristen Michal said on X. “My government will hold an extraordinary meeting this afternoon. We are in close contact with our Nordic-Baltic colleagues.” Two data cables – one running between Finland and Germany and the other between Lithuania and Sweden – were severed in November. Germany’s defence minister said officials had to assume the incident was “sabotage,” but without providing evidence or saying who might have been responsible. The remark came during a speech in which he discussed hybrid warfare threats from Russia. The Nord Stream natural gas pipelines that once brought natural gas from Russia to Germany were damaged by underwater explosions in September 2022. Authorities have termed it sabotage and launched criminal probes. The Estlink-2 cable was down for much of this year to repair damage from a short circuit that may have been caused by the cable’s complex positioning, ERR reported. Estonian network operator Elering says there was enough spare capacity to meet power needs on the Estonian side, public broadcaster ERR said on its website Readiness to support Ukraine “until it wins” has fallen sharply across western Europe at a critical time for the country, a survey has suggested. December polling by YouGov in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Denmark and the UK found public desire to stand by Ukraine until victory – even if that meant prolonging the war – had slumped in all seven countries over the past 12 months, the Guardian’s Europe correspondent Jon Henley writes. Support for an alternative resolution to the conflict – a negotiated end to the fighting, even if that left Russia in control of parts of Ukraine – had increased in every country, the survey found, and was the preferred option in four of them. There was some unhappiness at the idea of an imposed settlement that would involve Ukraine ceding territory to Russia, but also widespread belief that the new US president would abandon Ukraine after his inauguration on 20 January. Russia and Kazakhstan have sought to temper speculation about the cause of the Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash, with the Kremlin urging people to wait for the results of the investigation, writes the Guardian’s European community affairs correspondent Ashifa Kassam and Pjotr Sauer, the Russia affairs correspondent. A Ukrainian national security official has claimed that the crash, which killed 38 people on Christmas Day, was caused by Russian air defence fire. The plane, which was flying from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, to the Russian city of Grozny in Chechnya, came down in a field near Aktau in Kazakhstan after veering hundreds of miles off its planned route. Twenty-nine people survived. Here are the latest images coming out of Ukraine: Russia is willing to work with Donald Trump’s incoming administration to improve relations but it is up to Washington to make the first move, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said. Reuters reports: Trump, who returns as president on 20 January, styles himself as a master dealmaker and has vowed to swiftly end the war in Ukraine but not set out how he might achieve that beyond getting President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian counterpart President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to agree to end the fighting. Lavrov told reporters in Moscow: If the signals that are coming from the new team in Washington to restore the dialogue that Washington interrupted after the start of a special military operation (war in Ukraine), are serious, of course, we will respond to them. But the Americans broke (off) the dialogue, so they should make the first move. Russia’s top security agency has said that it has arrested several suspects accused of involvement in an alleged Ukrainian plot to assassinate senior military officers, an announcement that follows the killing of a top Russian general last week. Associated Press reports: The Federal Security Service, a top KGB successor known under its Russian acronym FSB, said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies that it had arrested four Russians accused of making preparations to kill senior Defense Ministry officials. The FSB said that the suspected organisers of the attacks were planning to kill one of the senior officers using a remotely controlled car bomb. It added that another top military official was to be assassinated by an explosive device hidden in an envelope. The agency didn’t name the military officers who were targeted in the alleged plot. The FSB released a video showing the arrest and interrogation of the suspects, who weren’t named. A Russian drone attack on the central market in the Ukrainian town of Nikopol injured eight on Thursday morning, local authorities said. Seven of those injured were hospitalised after the strike damaged multiple stalls at the market, Dnipropetrovsk governor Serhiy Lysak wrote via the Telegram messaging app. The drone strike comes after Russia’s Christmas Day attack on the country’s energy system killed one person in the region. The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that it shot down 20 drones out of 31 launched by Russia overnight. Of the 31 drones, 11 “imitator drones” did not reach their targets due to active engagement from the Ukrainian military, it added. The Russian defence ministry has claimed that Russian forces have captured a village of Hihant in eastern Ukraine, the RIA news agency has reported. Reuters could not independently confirm battlefield reports from either side. Azerbaijan is observing a nationwide day of mourning for the victims of the air crash that killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured as speculation mounted about a possible cause of the crash that remained unknown. The Associated Press reports: Azerbaijan Airlines’ Embraer 190 was en route from Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus on Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons yet unclear and crashed while making an attempt to land in Aktau in Kazakhstan. The plane went down about 3 kilometers or 2 miles from Aktau after crossing the Caspian Sea. Cellphone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before smashing into the ground in a fireball. Azerbaijan on Thursday observed a nationwide day of mourning for the victims of the air crash that killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured as speculation mounted about a possible cause of the crash that remained unknown. Azerbaijan Airlines’ Embraer 190 was en route from Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus on Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons yet unclear and crashed while making an attempt to land in Aktau in Kazakhstan after flying east across the Caspian Sea. Russia’s civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said that preliminary information indicated that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board. According to Kazakh officials, those aboard the plane included 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russian nationals, six Kazakhs and three Kyrgyzstan nationals. As the official crash investigation started, theories abounded about a possible cause, with some commentators alleging that holes seen in the plane’s tail section possibly indicate that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the provincial capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country’s North Caucasus. Some Russian media claimed that another drone attack on Chechnya happened on Wednesday, although it wasn’t officially confirmed. Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation security firm based in the United Kingdom, warned its clients that the “Azerbaijan Airlines flight was likely shot down by a Russian military air-defense system.” Osprey provides analysis for carriers still flying into Russia after Western airlines halted their flights during the war. Osprey CEO Andrew Nicholson said that the company had issued more than 200 alerts regarding drone attacks and air defense systems in Russia during the war. The Ukrainian military has said that its air force had carried out a strike on a military industrial facility in Russia’s Rostov region over the past few days. The facility in the town of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky was used to produce solid fuel for ballistic missiles used in Russian attacks on Ukraine, the Ukrainian military said. It did not give a date for the attack or say what damage was caused. Russia thinks a weak ceasefire to freeze the war in Ukraine would be futile and counterproductive, and instead would rather a legally binding deal for a lasting peace that would ensure the security of both Russia and its neighbours, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said. He said he suspected a weak truce would be used by the west to re-arm Ukraine, adding: A truce is a path to nowhere. We need final legal agreements that will fix all the conditions for ensuring the security of the Russian Federation and, of course, the legitimate security interests of our neighbours. He added that Moscow wanted the legal documents drafted in such a way to ensure “the impossibility of violating these agreements.” He also said that Ukraine repeatedly hits civilian targets in Russia with Western missiles and drones and Moscow will respond. Russia targets only military facilities and infrastructure and “it’s not in our rules to strike civilian targets,” he added. Separately, Lavrov said that the new ruler of Syria had called relations with Russia long standing and strategic and that Moscow shared this assessment. Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said on Monday that Russia was in contact with Syria’s new administration at both a diplomatic and military level. Peskov added that the investigation into the cause of the Azerbaijan Airlines plane crash is underway and it is wrong to speculate before it gives its conclusions. An Embraer EMBR3.SA passenger jet crashed near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan on Wednesday, killing 38 people, after diverting from an area of Russia that Moscow has recently defended against Ukrainian drone attacks. Hello – Welcome to the Guardian’s blog covering the Russia-Ukraine war. The Ukrainian military has said that it shot down 20 drones out of 31 launched by Russia overnight. Of the 31 drones, 11 “imitator-drones” did not reach their targets due to active engagement from the Ukrainian military, it added. Here are yesterday’s key developments, after Russia launched a Christmas Day attack against some of Ukraine’s cities. Joe Biden has asked the US defence department to continue its surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine, describing Russia’s Christmas Day attack against some of Ukraine’s cities and its energy infrastructure as “outrageous”. Christmas morning in Ukraine was overshadowed by a massive Russian aerial attack using cruise missiles to target energy infrastructure across the country, which Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned as “inhuman”. The attack left half a million people in Kharkiv region without heating, in temperatures just a few degrees Celsius above zero, while there were blackouts in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere. Ukraine’s air defences downed 59 of 78 Russian missiles and 54 of 102 drones launched overnight and on Wednesday morning, the Ukrainian military said. British prime minister Keir Starmer has also condemned the Russian attack launched on Ukraine’s energy grid, which killed one person. Nato member Romania said it had not detected any Russian missile passing through its airspace to target Ukraine, as claimed by Kyiv. Russia’s Federal Security Service claimed on Thursday that it had foiled several plots by Ukrainian intelligence services to kill high-ranking Russian military officers and their families in Moscow. It claimed four Russian citizens allegedly involved in the plots had been detained. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence service has claimed responsibility for the killing of Igor Kirillov, chief of Russia’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection troops, who died after a bomb attached to an electric scooter exploded outsided his apartment building on 17 December. A Russian cargo ship that sank on Tuesday in the Mediterranean Sea was the target of an “act of terrorism”, according to the vessel’s owner. The Ursa Major sank while it was sailing through international waters between Spain and Algeria, leaving two crew members missing. The Ukrainian navy spokesperson Dmytro Pletenchuk said Russia faced “systemic problems” in maintaining its fleet but gave no indication that Kyiv was involved in the incident. Falling debris from a Ukrainian drone that was shot down caused an explosion and a fatal fire in a shopping centre in the city of Vladikavkaz in Russia’s North Ossetia region, the local governor said on Wednesday. One woman was reported to have been killed inside the shopping centre. Russia’s foreign ministry said Australia had been in contact about the possible capture by the Russian army of an Australian citizen fighting with Ukrainian forces. Oscar Jenkins was reportedly captured by Russian soldiers while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region. Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a call with the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, where he thanked Japan’s government for a decision to transfer an additional $3bn secured from frozen Russian assets. The Ukrainian leader also thanked Japan for the total $12bn in humanitarian and financial aid provided to Ukraine, according to a readout of the Wednesday call. We’ll be keeping you updated with all the most important happenings throughout the rest of the day."

Sergei Sobyanin said emergency services were working at the sites of the downed drones, but gave no information on potential damage. Officials at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport reported delays in departures after flights were temporarily paused. Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsiya said the measures were taken in response to “restrictions” over the capital’s airspace as well as strong winds. Rosaviatsiya said incoming and outgoing flights at airports in several other Russian cities were also temporarily halted, including at St Petersburg’s Pulkovo, citing safety concerns. Russia’s defence ministry said on Telegram that air defence units had destroyed 48 Ukrainian drones over a five-hour period on Saturday evening. Those included five drones in the region surrounding Moscow, two of which were headed for the capital. The ministry said the total included 17 drones over Bryansk region on the Ukrainian border and 11 in the adjacent Oryol region. The governor of Belgorod region on the border said four Ukrainian drones had injured a bus driver and a man driving a car. An earlier defence ministry report said 94 drones had been destroyed over Russia overnight on Saturday and 45 more in just under six hours during the day. Ukraine’s special forces struck Russia’s Borisoglebsk military airfield in the Voronezh region on Saturday, hitting a glide bomb store and a trainer aircraft. In a statement on social media, the Ukrainian military said other aircraft were also likely hit in the south-western Russian region, without giving details. “This airfield is the home base of enemy Su-34, Su-35S and Su-30SM aircraft,” the statement said. The governor of Voronezh, Alexander Gusev, wrote on Telegram that more than 25 drones were destroyed overnight over the region. He said a power line was temporarily damaged, but made no mention of a military airfield, which is about 300km from the Ukrainian border. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, unilaterally halted an agreed shipment of military aid to Ukraine due to baseless concerns that US stockpiles of weapons have run too low, it has been reported. The Guardian’s Oliver Milman writes that a batch of air defence missiles and other precision munitions were due to be sent to Ukraine under a promise made during Joe Biden’s administration last year, but the Pentagon halted the shipment – reportedly a decision made solely by Hegseth. However, Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell seemed to confirm that there is no current shortage of arms for US forces. “Let it be known that our military has everything that it needs to conduct any mission, anywhere, anytime, all around the world,” he said. Ukraine’s top military commander Oleksandr Syrskyi has warned of a possible new Russian offensive in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. “I dedicated two days to working with units in Kharkiv region,” Syrskyi wrote on Telegram. He said he spent the time talking to commanders, studying the situation in the area and the needs of troops there. “The Russians are looking to press with numbers, but we have to be ready, use appropriate tactical and technological solutions not to allow the [Russians] to move forward,” he said. Russian forces have already pushed into northern Ukraine’s Sumy region over the past months, carving out a small foothold there."
world/2025/feb/24/un-general-assembly-russia-ukraine-war,UN general assembly backs resolution condemning Russia for Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/un-general-assembly-russia-ukraine-war,UN general assembly backs resolution condemning Russia for Ukraine war,"The United Nations general assembly has backed a resolution drafted by Ukraine and the European Union condemning Russia on the third anniversary of its full-scale invasion, spurning a rival US resolution reflecting Donald Trump’s split with Europe and growing union with Vladimir Putin. The United States, Russia, Belarus and North Korea all voted against the EU-Ukrainian resolution underlining an extraordinary shift in US policy since the US president’s election that has largely absolved the Russian president of responsibility for the invasion. In the vote, 93 countries supported the joint European resolution that named Russia an aggressor state and called on it to remove its troops from Ukraine, while 18 countries including the US and Russia voted against. The vote came as Trump met with Emmanuel Macron at the White House on Monday and the two spoke with G7 leaders to discuss peace talks to end the war and the growing gulf between Washington and European capitals over the future of the Nato alliance. Germany’s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, warned this weekend that Europe should seek greater independence from the United States and said it was an “absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA”. Macron told reporters outside the White House that the G7 call was “perfect” but did not offer other details. Trump released a statement in which he said that all members of the G7 had said they wanted to achieve peace and that the war would never have happened if he had been president. Trump has quickly moved to direct talks with Putin that have eschewed Ukraine and has also sought to strong-arm Kyiv into a “critical minerals and rare-earths deal” to recoup the cost of US support for Ukraine in the three years since Putin launched his full-scale invasion. “I am in serious discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia concerning the ending of the War, and also major Economic Development transactions which will take place between the United States and Russia,” Trump said on Monday. “Talks are proceeding very well!” The UN votes on Monday were mostly symbolic. The US resolution was three paragraphs long and did not include any mention of Russia aggression, saying it “implores a swift end to the conflict and further urges a lasting peace between Ukraine and the Russian Federation”. The Russian ambassador to the UN had called the US resolution a “good move”. The US sought a “simple, historic statement from the general assembly that looks forward, not backwards”, said Ambassador Dorothy Shea, the US chargé d’affaires at the UN. “A resolution focused on one, simple idea: ending the war. A path to peace is possible. “Mr President, that is why the United States opposed putting forward another resolution,” she continued. “And that is why we cannot support Ukraine’s resolution, and we urge its withdrawal in favor of a strong statement committing us to end the war and work towards a lasting peace.” The US proposal did not call for a ceasefire or any concrete action because it believed that would increase resistance from Russia and Ukraine. Asked by a reporter if the US was seeking “global support for vague peace”, one state department official responded: “Absolutely. That’s what the UN is all about.” “This is a simple way to begin to acknowledge, and for everyone who agrees, that this is ending,” another official clarified. The US had sought to kill the Ukrainian co-sponsored resolution, and US diplomats had pressured EU and Ukrainian officials in foreign capitals this weekend to withdraw their resolution before Monday’s vote, according to cables to US embassies and reports in US media. State department officials speaking on background said that the US was in discussions with the UK and France just hours before a vote in the UN security council on a resolution calling for peace that has been broadly dismissed by Ukraine and European countries as whitewashing Russia’s invasion of the country. “President Trump is committed to ending the Russia-Ukraine war and to a resolution that leads to a lasting peace, not just a temporary pause,” the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said in a statement on Friday. “The United States has proposed a simple, historic resolution in the United Nations that we urge all member states to support in order to chart a path to peace.” The UN vote was preceded by a diplomatic scramble that saw both EU and US diplomats seeking to shore up support from countries in Africa, Asia and South America. “We have been doing what we do as diplomats, which is going to capitals, a lot of engagement over the weekend from our career professional diplomats who are in each one of the capitals,” said a state department official. “We have seen several countries switch from removing their co-sponsorship of the Ukrainian resolution to support for the United States resolution. We are continuing that diplomacy relentlessly, and that will continue until we have a vote.”"

Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said Russia had returned 1,200 bodies, and “according to the Russian side, the bodies belong to Ukrainian citizens, in particular military personnel”. The repatriation of the bodies was carried out with the help of Ukraine’s armed forces, the country’s security service, the interior ministry and other government agencies, its statement said. Forensic experts would now work to identify the remains. The repatriation marks one of the war’s largest returns of remains. Russia says its forces have captured another village in Ukraine’s north-eastern Sumy region amid its ramped-up offensive there. Moscow’s defence ministry said on Friday it had taken control of the village of Yablunivka, about 9km (five miles) from the Russian border. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Ukrainian forces are “gradually pushing back the occupiers” in the border region but prevailing assessments have shown Russian gains. Russia’s defence ministry said Russian forces had also taken control of two other Ukrainian villages – Koptevo and Komar in the eastern Donetsk region, Russia’s Tass news agency reported. The ministry said Russian troops had captured six Ukrainian villages over the past week. The battlefield reports could not be independently verified. A 73-year-old American jailed by Russia as a mercenary for Ukraine protested his innocence when his US-based legal team and family finally tracked him down in April, months after he vanished into the vast Russian prison system, they said. Stephen Hubbard, a retired schoolteacher, was sentenced last October to almost seven years in a penal colony and Russian state media reported that he had entered a guilty plea in the closed-door trial. His US-based lawyer, who made his first public comments on the case to the New York Times this week, said: “The first thing Hubbard wanted to talk about when he was able to make contact with the outside world was: ‘It’s not true.’” US officials have requested his immediate release. Ukraine’s air force said on Friday that Russia fired 55 Shahed and decoy drones and four ballistic missiles at Ukraine overnight. The air force said air defences had neutralised 43 drones. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. Russia’s defence ministry, meanwhile, said its air defences had downed 125 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions and the annexed region of Crimea into early Friday. • This picture caption in this article was amended on 19 June 2025.

world/2025/oct/29/ukraine-war-briefing-moscow-under-drone-siege-for-third-night-running,Ukraine war briefing: Moscow under drone siege for third night running,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/ukraine-war-briefing-moscow-under-drone-siege-for-third-night-running,Ukraine war briefing: Moscow under drone siege for third night running,"Ukraine sent drones towards Moscow for the third consecutive night, closing airports, Russian authorities said late on Tuesday. Rosaviatsiya, the air transport watchdog, said Moscow’s Sheremetyevo, Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports had flights halted or restricted. Russia usually says all incoming drones were destroyed, regardless of the outcome, and typically gives limited details about the effects of Ukrainian strikes unless civilians or civilian infrastructure are hit. Over the previous two nights, Russia’s defence ministry said there were 35 Ukrainian drones destroyed over the Moscow region. Ukraine says its long-range drone strikes of recent months on Moscow and other Russian regions are aimed at hitting military and industrial assets, damaging Russia’s war economy and bringing the conflict home to Russians. Ukraine also launched several drones targeting the Budyonnovsk industrial zone in Russia’s Stavropol oblast, said its governor, Vladimir Vladimirov. Online reporting suggested the drones targeted a petrochemical and plastics plant, with videos showing a fire. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and leaders of Nordic countries said on Tuesday that they were confident that using frozen Russian assets for Ukraine’s benefit would be approved by December. EU leaders last week stopped short of approving a mammoth “reparations loan” backed by the assets, because Belgium, where the bulk of the €200bn pot is held, fears facing any legal consequences alone. Instead, they told the European Commission to move ahead with options for funding Ukraine for two more years, leaving the door open for a €140bn “reparations loan” using frozen Russian assets. “It’s legally a sound proposal, not trivial, but a sound proposal,” said von der Leyen. Russia is poised to enforce year-long military conscription, rather than just in the spring and autumn. Russian conscripts are theoretically not liable to be sent to Ukraine, but human rights groups and media reports say many have been coerced into signing contracts as volunteers for the war. The Russian parliament is in the process of approving a permanent draft. Putin has ordered the number of active troops to be increased by 180,000, to 1.5 million. He said in September that the military has over 700,000 troops fighting in Ukraine. Putin in 2022 ordered a “partial mobilisation” of 300,000 reservists into the war but was forced to abandon the hugely unpopular programme after protests erupted, recruiting stations were burned and many thousands of men fled to other countries. Russia has since relied on recruiting volunteers with the promise of relatively high wages and other benefits. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukrainian and European officials would meet at the end of the week to discuss the details of a ceasefire plan, Reuters reported. “It is not a plan to end the war. First of all, a ceasefire is needed,” said the Ukrainian president. “This is a plan to begin diplomacy … Our advisers will meet in the coming days, we agreed on Friday or Saturday. They will discuss the details of this plan.” Ukraine plans to begin limited exports of weapons next month, Zelenskyy said. During his meeting with a government team, Zelenskyy also ordered a continued increase in drone production and sought to ensure that domestically produced weapons and ammunition cover about 50% of the army’s needs. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, announced plans to reopen two border crossings with Belarus in Kuźnica-Bruzgi and Bobrowniki to facilitate local traffic and trade, saying it was possible thanks to strengthened controls alongside the entire border line. Poland closed its border with Belarus on 12 September as a result of Russia-led military exercises taking place in Belarus and 21 Russian drones entering Polish airspace on the night of 9-10 September. Tusk noted that the opening needed to be coordinated with Lithuania, acknowledging its decision to close its crossings with Belarus in response to balloons coming across the border over the last week. Lithuania says the balloons are used to smuggle cigarettes but the Belarusian ruler, Alexander Lukashenko, allows the flights to take place as a form of “hybrid warfare” harassment."
world/2025/jun/29/ukraine-war-briefing-key-eastern-ukrainian-city-under-assault-as-russia-hails-cooperation-with-north-korea,Ukraine war briefing: key eastern Ukrainian city under assault as Russia hails cooperation with North Korea ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/29/ukraine-war-briefing-key-eastern-ukrainian-city-under-assault-as-russia-hails-cooperation-with-north-korea,Ukraine war briefing: key eastern Ukrainian city under assault as Russia hails cooperation with North Korea ,"Ukraine’s top commander said on Saturday his forces faced a new onslaught against a key city on the eastern front of its war against Russia, while Moscow said it was making progress in another sector farther south-west. Russian troops are focused on capturing all of the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine and the city of Kostiantynivka has been a major target. Ukrainian forces have for months defended the city against fierce assaults. Top Ukrainian commander Oleksandr Syrskyi, writing on Telegram, said the area around Kostiantynivka was gripped by heavy fighting. “The enemy is surging towards Kostiantynivka, but apart from sustaining numerous losses, has achieved nothing,” Syrskyi said. “The aggressor is trying to break through our defences and advance along three operating sectors.” Russia’s defence ministry, in a report earlier in the day, said Moscow’s forces had seized the village of Chervona Zirka – further south-west, near the administrative border of the Dnipropetrovsk region. Russia’s slow advance through eastern Ukraine, with Moscow claiming a string of villages day after day, has resulted in destruction of major cities and infrastructure. Meanwhile Russia’s culture minister, Olga Lyubimova, arrived in North Korea on Saturday with a 125-strong delegation of performers. Lyubimova, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said that thanks to agreements clinched between Russian president Vladimir Putin and North Korea leader Kim Jong-un, “cooperation in the cultural sphere between our countries has reached unprecedented heights”. She said a series of concerts and lectures would take place in the North Korean capital in the coming days. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow and Pyongyang have drawn closer together, with the two leaders signing a treaty, including a mutual defence pact. After months of silence, North Korea and Russia disclosed the deployment of North Korean troops and the role they played in Moscow’s offensive to evict Ukrainian troops from the Kursk region. Moscow has insisted that progress towards a settlement of the war depends on Ukraine recognising Moscow’s control over four Ukrainian regions: Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. Russian forces control about one-fifth of Ukraine’s territory, but they do not fully hold any of the four regions. A Ukrainian pilot was killed and his F-16 fighter jet lost while repelling a large-scale Russian night-time missile and drone attack, the Ukrainian military said on Sunday. It was the third such loss of an F-16 in the war, the military said. “The pilot used all of his onboard weapons and shot down seven air targets. While shooting down the last one, his aircraft was damaged and began to lose altitude,” the air force said on the Telegram app. Russia used hundreds of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles in the attack in western, southern and central Ukraine overnight, damaging homes and infrastructure and injuring at least six people, local authorities said. The sounds of explosions were heard in Lviv, Poltava, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Cherkasy regions, regional governors said. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has said it is “extremely important” for Kyiv to maintain friendly ties with neighbouring Poland, where the incoming nationalist leader Karol Nawrocki opposes Ukraine’s Nato bid. Nawrocki won Poland’s presidential election this month after a campaign in which he criticised Ukraine and accused Zelenskyy of “indecent” behaviour towards his allies. Poland is one of Ukraine’s closest allies and has served as a crucial logistics hub for western military aid to help Kyiv’s war effort against Russia’s now more than three-year-long invasion. Zelenskyy hosted outgoing Polish president Andrzej Duda in Kyiv on Saturday, ahead of Nawrocki’s inauguration on 6 August. “Poland is now preparing for the inauguration of its new president, (Karol) Nawrocki,” Zelenskyy told reporters alongside Duda. “We will do everything in our power to ensure that relations between our countries only grow stronger.” Poland has taken in more than a million Ukrainians since Russia’s invasion of the country began in 2022. But anti-Ukrainian sentiment has grown in recent years."
world/2025/may/23/ukraine-russia-largest-pow-exchange,Ukraine and Russia exchange 800 PoWs in largest prisoner swap of war so far,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/23/ukraine-russia-largest-pow-exchange,Ukraine and Russia exchange 800 PoWs in largest prisoner swap of war so far,"Ukraine and Russia have begun the largest prisoner exchange of the three-year war, with almost 800 captives returned on both sides in a process expected to last several days. Confirming the first phase of the exchange had taken place, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had returned 390 people to Russia and that the process would continue with further groups on Saturday and Sunday. “It’s very important to bring everyone home,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram, thanking all who worked to secure their return and pledging to continue diplomatic efforts to make more exchanges possible. “The agreement on the release of 1,000 of our people from Russian captivity was almost the only real result of the [direct talks between Russian and Ukraine a week ago in] Turkey,” he added elsewhere on social media. Images from the arrival of returned Ukrainian PoWs, released by Zelenskyy’s office showed shaven-headed former prisoners being greeted by their families. The released Russians were taken to Belarus for medical treatment, the Russian defence ministry said. The exchange, which is also the biggest swap of Ukrainian civilians at one time, didn’t appear to herald any imminent halt in fighting. Ukrainian media outlet Espreso TV published a video of the wife of a prisoner crying tears of joy, wrapped in a flag on Kyiv’s Independence Square. She said she had been waiting for her husband’s release since 2022 and had just received the call from Ukrainian authorities confirming his release. “We waited, hoped and fought,” said the woman, whose name was given as Victoria. The exchange is part of the “1,000 for 1,000” deal thrashed out during otherwise inconclusive peace talks in Istanbul a week ago. The first stage of the swap took place at the border with Belarus in northern Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Earlier, Ukrainian authorities told reporters to assemble at a location in the northern Chernihiv region in anticipation that some freed prisoners could be brought there. Confirming the exchange had taken place, Russia’s defence ministry said it had completed the first phase which it said saw the return of 270 military personnel and 120 civilians it claimed had been captured during Ukraine’s long incursion into the Kursk region of Russia. The status of those being exchanged could not immediately be confirmed. At a medical facility where the released Ukrainians were due to be taken, relatives waited to see whether their loved ones would be part of the swap. Svitlana Kuskova, 49, held a sign with a photo of her husband, Oleksandr Kuskov, missing for the past year. Kuskov was a military driver who was later transferred to the infantry, and his wife has searched through Russian military channels, hoping to catch a glimpse of him or some sign he is still alive. “It’s extremely hard to go to sleep every night not knowing what happened to him,” she said. Olessia Dyadushkin, 37, held a photo of her 40-year-old husband, Valentin, missing since July 2024. Although she had no information about him, she has held onto hope because there was no confirmation that he was killed. Her four-year-old daughter often asks where her father is, and she tells her he’s at work and very busy, Dyadushkin said, wiping away tears. Russia and Ukraine have swapped hundreds of captured soldiers, but the Kremlin has been reluctant to free non-combatants. In April, the Guardian and its reporting partners published the Viktoriia project, an investigation into the abduction and systematic torture of what Ukraine believes could be as many as 16,000 of its civilians. In many cases they do not have access to lawyers and their families have not been informed of their whereabouts. Among them was the Ukrainian investigative reporter Viktoriia Roshchyna, who died in a Russian jail last year after setting out to report on the enforced disappearances. While the exchange had been expected to start as early as Friday, speculation increased after the US president, Donald Trump, said – incorrectly at the time of his writing – that Russia and Ukraine had already completed the large exchange of prisoners, an assertion quickly denied by Ukrainian officials who said the swap was ongoing. “A major prisoners swap was just completed between Russia and Ukraine,” Trump said on the Truth Social platform. He said it would “go into effect shortly”, although it was not clear what that meant. “This could lead to something big???” Trump added in his post, apparently referring to international diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting. After the 16 May talks, the Turkish foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, called the prisoner swap a “confidence-building measure” and said the parties had agreed in principle to meet again. However, on Friday, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, rejected the idea of holding future peace talks with Ukraine at the Vatican, dismissing a proposal made earlier this week by Trump. Speaking at an ultra-nationalist conference in Moscow, Lavrov argued that the Vatican would be an inappropriate venue, saying it would be “not quite comfortable” for two Orthodox nations to meet in a Catholic venue. He repeated some of Russia’s widely debunked justifications for launching the war, claiming that talks in the Vatican were not appropriate because one of the war’s root causes was Ukraine’s alleged oppression of Orthodox believers. “One of the root causes is the course towards elimination of the Ukrainian Orthodox church,” Lavrov said. “I believe the Vatican would not be quite comfortable to host delegations from two Orthodox countries under such circumstances.” In a string of hawkish remarks, Lavrov also signalled that Moscow remains committed to regime change in Ukraine, questioning Zelenskyy’s legitimacy and referring to the elected Ukrainian government as a “junta”. Lavrov said Moscow would not allow Russian-speakers in Ukraine to remain under the rule of Zelenskyy, adding that the simplest way to settle the conflict would be for the international community to demand that Ukraine cancel laws discriminating against Russian-speakers. The foreign minister also questioned Zelenskyy’s legitimacy to sign any peace agreement, adding that new elections would be the most “appropriate” way to determine who is entitled to represent Ukraine in future negotiations. At least 8,000 Ukrainian soldiers are being held captive by Russia, Iryna Vereshchuk, the presidential office deputy head, said on 1 May, citing data from Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of PoWs. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides are believed to have been wounded or killed in Europe’s deadliest war since the second world war, although neither side publishes accurate casualty figures. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians have also died as Russian forces have besieged and bombarded Ukraine’s cities. Agencies contributed to this report"

Zelenskyy said the captured fighters were two of many more Chinese members of the Russian armed forces, and he accused the Kremlin of trying to involve Beijing in the conflict “directly or indirectly”. A few hundred Chinese nationals are thought to have travelled to fight as mercenaries with the Russian army alongside others from Nepal and central Asian countries. US state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the development “disturbing”, adding: “China is a major enabler of Russia in the war in Ukraine.” Russian forces staged massive drone attacks on the Ukrainian cities of Dnipro and Kharkiv late on Tuesday, triggering fires and injuring at least 17 people, regional officials said. In eastern Donetsk, the focal point of the 1,000-km (600-mile) frontline in the more than three-year-old war, a residential area came under attack in the city of Kramatorsk and local officials said residents were injured. In Dnipro, the attack sparked a fire, damaged houses and cars and injured 14 people, Serhiy Lysak, governor of Dnipropetrovsk region, said on Telegram. Russia says it is close to regaining full control of its western Kursk region after pushing Ukrainian forces from one of their last footholds there. Russia’s defence ministry released a video of what it said was the recapture of the settlement of Guyevo set to dramatic music, showing smoke rising into the air from various buildings, a soldier waving the Russian flag from the window of a heavily damaged Orthodox church, and Russian troops carrying out house-to-house checks in case any Ukrainian soldiers were hiding. Ukraine officials have not commented on Russia’s claims, but its general staff said in a statement its planes had struck a complex of hangars and military buildings in the region being used by Russian drone operators and maintenance workers. The US senate has confirmed the appointment of Elbridge Colby as its top policy adviser at the Pentagon, despite concerns he had downplayed threats from Russia and Vladimir Putin. Colby previously questioned whether Russia actually invaded Ukraine, echoing a false Kremlin talking point. After side-stepping repeated questions on whether he believed Russia did invade the country, he was forced to agree it had. US and Russian delegates will hold talks on Thursday in Istanbul on restoring some of their embassy operations that have been drastically scaled back following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the US state department confirmed."

A residential high-rise building is on fire” and rescuers were pulling people out, he said. The Odesa region’s emergency service said later that five people were rescued from burning apartments but “one rescued woman died”. The Russian defence ministry said its air defence systems destroyed 87 Ukrainian drones in a five-hour period on Friday evening, including over the Bryansk region bordering northern Ukraine and the Moscow region. Russian aviation authorities were once again forced to suspend flights at Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo airports serving Moscow. The Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said 13 drones were downed or destroyed after midnight, but made no mention of casualties or damage. The acting governor of Rostov region, on Ukraine’s eastern border, said Ukrainian drones triggered fires and knocked down power lines. The EU on Friday agreed an 18th package of sanctions against Russia, including measures aimed at restricting the Russian oil and energy industry. The EU will set a moving price cap on Russian crude at 15% below its average market price, aiming to improve on a largely ineffective $60 cap that the G7 economies have tried to impose since December 2022. The measures were approved after Slovakia dropped its opposition in exchange for further guarantees on gas imports. Kaja Kallas said the measures by the EU would be “one of its strongest sanctions packages against Russia to date”. “We will keep raising the costs, so stopping the aggression becomes the only path forward for Moscow,” said the EU foreign policy chief. The UK announced it would join the price cap, dealing a blow to Moscow’s oil revenues. “The UK and its EU allies are turning the screw on the Kremlin’s war chest by stemming the most valuable funding stream of its illegal war in Ukraine even further,” said the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, at a G20 meeting in South Africa. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, complained to reporters that Russia considered “such unilateral restrictions illegal”. “We oppose them,” he said. “But at the same time, of course, we have already acquired a certain immunity from sanctions. We have adapted to life under sanctions.” The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said the possibility of Ukraine joining the EU by 2034 was unlikely. “For us, the absolute top priority is, first and foremost, to do everything possible to end this war,” Merz said on Friday. “Then we’ll talk about the reconstruction of Ukraine … but that’s going to take a number of years.” He said it would “probably not even affect the EU’s current medium-term financial outlook”, which runs to 2034. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in Kyiv in February that Ukraine could join the EU before 2030 if the country continued reforms at the current speed and quality. Ukraine’s top military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Friday that his forces were “containing intense pressure” from Russia on Pokrovsk, a logistics hub in eastern Donetsk region that has weathered months of Russian attempts to capture it. Syrskyi said he had presented a report to the president describing the challenges facing Ukrainian troops along the 1,000km (620-mile) front. “The enemy is continuing to deploy its tactic of small infantry groups, but has proved powerless on its attempts to seize Pokrovsk. Today, they tried to break through with sabotage groups but were exposed and destroyed,” Syrskyi wrote on Telegram. The first tranche of Australian tanks has been handed over to the Ukrainian army. Australia had previously pledged to give Ukraine 49 Abrams tanks last October. A majority of the tanks have been delivered and a final tranche will arrive in the coming months, but actual numbers have not been released."
us-news/2025/aug/23/pentagon-ukraine-russia-missiles,Pentagon has blocked Ukraine from striking deep inside Russia – report,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/23/pentagon-ukraine-russia-missiles,Pentagon has blocked Ukraine from striking deep inside Russia – report,"US defense officials have blocked Ukraine from using US-supplied long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia since late spring as part of a Trump administration effort to get Vladimir Putin to engage in peace talks , according to a report on Saturday. The Wall Street Journal reports that the Pentagon has blocked Ukraine from using US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems, or Atacms. Two US officials told the outlet that on at least one occasion, Ukraine had sought to use Atacms against a target but was denied under a “review mechanism” developed by Elbridge Colby, the Pentagon’s undersecretary for policy, that governs how US long-range weapons or those provided by European allies that rely on American intelligence and components can be used. The review process also applies to Britain’s Storm Shadow cruise missile because it depends on US targeting data, according to two US officials and a British official, the Journal said. The review system reportedly gives the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, approval over the use of the Atacms, which have a range of nearly 190 miles (305km). Ukraine was previously given authority by the Biden administration to use the missile system against targets inside Russia in November after North Korean troops entered the war. Before the inauguration in January, Trump told Time magazine that the decision to allow Ukraine to use US weapons systems to attack targets inside Russia had been a mistake. “I disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that? We’re just escalating this war and making it worse. That should not have been allowed to be done,” he said. It is unclear whether the US defense department’s review process amounts to a formal policy change. But it comes alongside increasing control of munitions to Ukraine as US stocks are themselves depleted. In a statement to the Journal, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Trump “has been very clear that the war in Ukraine needs to end. There has been no change in military posture in Russia-Ukraine at this time.” But last week, amid efforts to broker talks between the Russian president and Voldomyr Zelenskyy, Trump said that Ukraine could not defeat Russia unless it could “play offense” in the war. “It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader’s country,” Trump wrote on Thursday. “It’s like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning.” Last month, the US agreed to supply Ukraine with new weapons systems but only if European nations paid for them. While Trump has said that the US is “not looking” to provide longer-range weapons that could reach Moscow, US officials told the Journal that the administration had approved the sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition air-launched missiles, or Erams, which have a range of 280 miles (400km)."

The soldiers died when a bomb blew up a section of track in Russia’s western Oryol region late on Saturday, said the local Russian governor, Andrei Klychkov. The source in Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence told AFP that in another attack, tanker carriages were “destroyed along with their fuel”. A Russian official confirmed the derailment of freight train carrying 15 fuel tankers between the villages of Stroganovo and Mshinskaya. The Ukrainian GRU source said attacks targeted supply lines for Russian forces in the Kharkiv and Sumy areas of Ukraine. “As a result of the destruction of the railway infrastructure in these areas, the Russians will experience significant logistical difficulties.” The Ukrainians said they also carried out a drone attack on a chemicals factory producing ingredients for explosives in Russia’s Perm region, more than 1,500km from the border between the two countries. Reports said the target was a plant in Gubakha town owned by Metafrax which is under UK and Ukrainian sanctions for supplying the Russian military. Ukrainian drones set the Kirishi oil refinery in Russia’s north-west on fire, Russian officials said on Sunday, reporting no injuries. The refinery is one of Russia’s largest. As Ukraine continued a steady and systematic wave of attacks aimed at depriving Russia of oil revenue, Volodymr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, said in his evening address: “The most effective sanctions – the sanctions that act the fastest – are fire on Russian oil refineries, their terminals, oil depots.” A cargo of ammunition blew up a train carriage near Boyarka outside Kyiv and damaged a section of track on Sunday. No one was injured, Ukrainian authorities said, although more than 200 passengers had to be evacuated and trains were rerouted around the damage. A Russian attack was not immediately suspected; the military cargo was confirmed by Ukraine’s military general staff. Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine’s prime minister, said: “The investigation into the causes of the incident is ongoing. Law enforcement agencies will provide more details later.” Ukraine’s navy said its forces hit a communications node of the Russian Black Sea fleet in Crimea. “On the night of September 11, units of the naval forces struck a communications node of the Russian Black Sea Fleet on the territory of the 184th scientific and research experimental base Sevastopol, in the temporarily occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The specified communications node provided control of the Russian Black Sea fleet units.” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that Ukrainian forces advanced in border districts of northern Sumy region where Russian troops have been trying to gain a foothold. “Our units are continuing to advance in the direction of Ukraine’s state border,” said the president. Moscow’s forces had also suffered significant losses in Donetsk and Kharkiv regions along the 1,000km (620-mile) frontline, said Zelenskyy, after a week of Russia proclaiming gains in the central Dnipropetrovsk region. The claims could not be independently verified. The Russia-appointed head of parts of Donetsk region under Moscow’s control, Denis Pushilin, said in a video posted online that Russian forces were attempting a pincer movement near villages around Pokrovsk. The Institute for the Study of War, in an analysis on Sunday, said Russian forces had recently advanced near Pokrovsk, Novopavlivka and Velykomykhailivka, and in the Kostyantynivka-Druzhkivka tactical area. The governor of Ukraine’s Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said on Telegram that two people had died in shelling and drone attacks in different parts of the region. Romania on Sunday protested about the entry of a Russian drone into its airspace during an attack on neighbouring Ukraine by summoning the Kremlin’s ambassador to the foreign ministry. Romania’s defence ministry said a Russian Geran drone “orbited for about 50 minutes, from north-east of [the village of] Chilia Veche to south-west of Izmail, and left national airspace near the town of Pardina, heading towards Ukraine”. Romania scrambled two F-16 fighter jets “supported by German allies … with two Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft”. Poland’s foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, meanwhile said that last week’s Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace was an attempt by the Kremlin to test Nato’s reactions. Polish anti-drone teams will receive training from Ukrainian operators to help defend against future attacks, said Sikorski, who was attending the annual Yalta European Strategy conference in Ukraine, writes Shaun Walker."

Russia has accused Kyiv of being behind the blast on Friday, which killed Gen Yaroslav Moskalik. The FSB alleged a Ukrainian agent it named as Ignat Kuzin rigged a Volkswagen Golf in the city of Balashikha with a homemade explosive device from a Ukrainian secret service stash in the Moscow area and that the bomb was then detonated remotely from Ukraine. A video released by the FSB showed a man identified as Kuzin, and what was said to be his arrest taking place on a forest road. Kyiv has not commented on the blast, which bore the hallmarks of previous attacks on military figures and high-profile backers of the Kremlin’s offensive. Donald Trump has said he doubts Vladimir Putin wants to end his war in Ukraine and expressed scepticism that a peace deal can be reached soon. The comments come only a day after Trump said Ukraine and Russia were “very close to a deal”. As William Christou writes, Trump said on Saturday that “there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days … It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.” Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, sat down for a face-to-face talk in the Vatican basilica to discuss a possible ceasefire. The White House described Trump’s meeting with Zelenskyy as “very productive”, while Zelenskyy said the talk with the US president was symbolic and had the “potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results”. Trump suggested after the meeting that he might put secondary sanctions on Russia and/or ratchet up banking restrictions. Andrew Roth writes that for months, Zelenskyy and European leaders have struggled to get through to Trump that Putin does not want to stop the war. Now they might see hope for a change, but, Roth writes in his analysis, “This could, of course, all come to naught. The US president is notoriously mercurial.” A possible second Trump-Zelenskyy meeting in Rome did not take place. Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday, after a “very positive” exchange with Zelenskyy, that Ukraine was ready for an unconditional ceasefire with the help of the US and Europe, and that the so-called “coalition of the willing” led by France and Britain would continue working on achieving that, as well as on “ending the war in Ukraine. That is an objective that we share in common with President Trump.” Zelenskyy also met the British prime minister, Keir Starmer; Italy’s PM, Giorgia Meloni; and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. Ukraine’s military on Saturday denied Russian claims that Ukrainian troops had been forced out of their last footholds in Russia’s Kursk region. The Ukrainian military’s general staff said its forces were continuing their operations in some districts of Kursk region, and its incursion into another part of Russia, Belgorod region, was still under way. The Trump administration is letting a Russian Gazprom subsidiary continue operating in Serbia without sanctions for at least the next two months, according to Serbian president Aleksandar Vucic. NIS, majority-owned by Russia’s Gazprom, runs the only oil refinery in Serbia. Joe Biden put it under sanctions in January as he was leaving office, giving Gazprom 45 days to exit ownership of NIS. Since then it has received several waivers of sanctions related to the Russian war in Ukraine."

He restated that Ukraine had received high-level signals from Washington and its other western allies that arms supplies, paused for a time last week, had now resumed. “We are currently working with partners on new supplies, increased weapons production in Ukraine and better support for our army,” he said. “Next week, we will continue working with the US side on a military level … We are also preparing new European defence packages.” Kellogg, interviewed by the Ukrainian media outlet Novyny.LIVE while attending a conference about Ukraine in Rome, said: “We’ll be in Kyiv Monday. We’ll be there all week.” Donald Trump confirmed he had struck a deal with Nato leaders to supply weapons to Ukraine, Andrew Roth writes. During an interview with NBC News, the US president said: “So what we’re doing is the weapons that are going out are going to Nato, and then Nato is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and Nato is paying for those weapons.” He added: “I’m disappointed in Russia, but we’ll see what happens over the next couple of weeks.” The EU’s top diplomat has said the 27-nation bloc was pondering a new raft of sanctions against Moscow. “Russia has increased its attacks against civilians to really cause as much pain … and that’s unacceptable,” the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said. Brussels was considering an 18th round of sanctions against Moscow and “we are also still in negotiations to put the oil price cap on, that would deprive Russia from the means to fund this war”, she told AFP. Kallas said she was assured by Laos’s top diplomat that Vientiane had “no intention or willingness” to send military help to Russia, following claims that Moscow was planning to involve military personnel from Laos to bolster its efforts in Ukraine. “I also expressed that it has consequences for European aid to Laos if something like this is happening,” Kallas said. “If you [Laos] contribute to that existential threat, we can’t have good cooperation,” she warned. Ukrainian drone and shelling attacks killed three people in Russia on Friday. Russian air defence systems intercepted 155 Ukrainian drones overnight, Moscow said. There was one dead in Russia’s Lipetsk region and another was killed in the western Tula region from the drone attacks, local officials said. Ukrainian shelling later killed another civilian in the border region of Belgorod, the governor announced. The Russian defence ministry said out of the 155 downed Ukrainian drones, 11 were bound for Moscow. Ukraine said its drones struck a Russian fighter aircraft plant in the Moscow region and a missile production facility in the Tula region, causing explosions and fires at both. Ukraine’s military said on Telegram the aviation facility in the town of Lukhovitsy, about 135km (84 miles) south-east of Moscow, produced MiG fighters. The other site was the Instrument Design Bureau, which specialised in producing anti-aircraft missiles and missile-gun systems, it said. “Defence forces continue to take all steps to undermine the military and economic potential of the Russian occupiers,” the military said. Russian bombardments on eastern Ukraine overnight on Friday forced the evacuation of a maternity centre in Kharkiv and wounded nine people. Zelenskyy said a medical facility was hit in the attack on the country’s second-largest city. “Among the wounded are women in a maternity hospital – mothers with newborns, women recovering from surgery,” he wrote on social media. “Fortunately, no children were injured.” He added that several other regions were attacked overnight. Nato will need more long-range missiles in its arsenal to deter Russia from attacking Europe because Moscow is expected to increase production of long-range weapons, a US army general told Reuters. “The Russian army is bigger today than it was when they started the war in Ukraine,” Maj Gen John Rafferty said at a US military base in Wiesbaden, Germany. “And we know that they’re going to continue to invest in long-range rockets and missiles and sophisticated air defences. So more alliance capability is really, really important.” The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that wartime censorship in Russia is justified amid the conflict with Ukraine and the closure of opposition-minded media. Speaking to Russian magazine Expert, Peskov said that many media outlets have been closed, while some reporters have left the country in the past three years. “But don’t forget the situation we are in. Now is the time of military censorship, unprecedented for our country. After all, the war is going on in the information space too,” Peskov told the magazine. Russian authorities also blocked X, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. “It would be wrong to turn a blind eye to the media that are deliberately engaged in discrediting Russia,” he said."
world/2025/oct/23/drones-ukraine-wildfires-russia-heat-mines-shelling,Wildfires have consumed vast chunks of Ukraine. Is Russia deliberately fuelling the flames?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/23/drones-ukraine-wildfires-russia-heat-mines-shelling,Wildfires have consumed vast chunks of Ukraine. Is Russia deliberately fuelling the flames?,"Natalia Pryprosta was tending to her pigs when fire swept into the village of Studenok, near the city of Izium in eastern Ukraine. There was no time. She grabbed her papers, pulled her elderly mother into a friend’s car, and tried to get the animals out of the shed. Smoke and the speed of the blaze made it impossible. She didn’t see the animals burning, but learned of their fate later. Smoke smothered Studenok, turning the village as dark as night. Pryprosta’s neighbours fought the flames with shovels, digging in scorched earth to stop the crown fire’s advance. Firefighters arrived, but the blaze was relentless. At one point, it surged around a fire truck, trapping the crew. Mines and unexploded ordnance, left scattered since the Russian occupation and subsequent liberation in 2022, detonated in the heat. Each explosion fed the flames, sending burning debris, branches and embers flying across the village. Trees ignited, and wood fragments were hurled 700-800 metres, recalls Serhii Kohan, the village head. Only at about 9pm, when the wind shifted and the explosions subsided, could the units move in and finally begin to fight the flames. Pryprosta and the other villagers survived, huddled in a neighbouring settlement. When they returned, they found many homes burnt, along with blackened trees and mangled structures, another scar on a village already devastated by war. The highest number of fires on Ukraine-controlled territory this year have been in forests surrounding Izium in Kharkiv oblast (province), where Studenok sits, according to the state enterprise Forests of Ukraine. In the first eight months of 2025, Kharkiv oblast accounted for 60% of all forest fires. The fire that engulfed Studenok had ignited in a national park forest about 14 miles (23km) from the village and swept rapidly north, consuming 6,000 hectares (14,800 acres) as it burned. Waging war in a tinderbox Expanding wildfires have become part of the “new normal” in a hotter world. But the scale of burning in Ukraine is extraordinary even on those terms, far surpassing anything witnessed across the rest of Europe. In 2024, nearly a million hectares of Ukraine burned: more than twice the area that burned across the entire EU over the same period. Analysis by the Guardian and Kyiv Independent of satellite imagery, monitoring data and on-the-ground testimony connects the devastation of Ukraine’s forests directly to the Russian invasion. The fires have stretched in an arc across the frontline of the war in Ukraine. Blazes are concentrated in oblasts in the east, where the majority of fighting has taken place. The fires in Ukraine are unlike those in Canada and Siberia, where huge areas burn over several months. Monitoring data shows hundreds of small, frequent fires that burn at a low intensity, almost certainly started by explosions. Abandoned farmland that is becoming grassland or young forest accounts for a third of the burned area in 2024. Hot and dry conditions turned the frontline into a tinderbox, where blasts often became larger fires that were impossible to control safely due to the presence of landmines. That combination turned 2024 into one of the worst fire years on record in Donetsk, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia, says James MacCarthy, a research associate with Global Forest Watch. “In Donetsk alone, tree cover loss from fire was more than 40 times the long-term average for 2001 to 2023. Years of conflict, forest degradation and extreme heat have primed these landscapes to burn.” Rescue workers under attack National park workers and firefighters say the flames are not the only threat. As they attempt to douse them, they say they are being targeted by Russian drones. “Drones are always overhead,” says Serhii Skoryk, director of Kamianska Sich national park. “While a few of us put out the fire, two others stand by with rifles, watching to make sure a drone doesn’t fly in and hit the truck.” Park employees fight fires themselves because the state emergency service considers the territory too dangerous to operate in. At first, they put electronic warfare systems (which jam drone signals) on the fire trucks. But they found the jammers were not working on the latest generations of drones, so turned to borrowed hunting rifles to keep them at bay. “About 50% of the time, while we’re fighting a fire, a drone flies up to our fire truck and we have to neutralise it,” Skoryk says. Videos posted by Russian troops on social media show clearly marked fire trucks and personnel being attacked. Often these attacks follow a “double-tap” pattern, with an initial explosion causing a fire, and the same site attacked a second time after rescue and fire crews arrive. One Russian drone-operating brigade in Kherson regularly posts first-person footage videos from drone attacks to their Telegram channel. In one series of clips, the drone pilots target a petrol station, causing a fire. When the fire truck arrives to fight it, a second “suicide” drone flies headlong into the truck, exploding on impact. The Guardian and the Kyiv Independent cross-referenced those videos with photos provided by Ukraine’s state emergency service, of the fire truck’s cab damaged by the explosion. While damage and fires are a common consequence of war, deliberately targeting rescue workers, igniting fires or encouraging them to burn in a way that causes deliberate, long-term destruction of the environment would be considered a war crime under international law. The Russian government did not respond to a request for comment. Across Ukraine, prosecutors are working to determine whether attacks are intentionally targeting natural resources. Trees have provided both sides with cover from drones, making forests a target for deliberate fires, say experts. “There are no accidental shellings – every strike is a deliberate military action,” says Vitaliy Nikitin, deputy head of the Kherson regional prosecutor’s office. “Every instance of shelling that harms natural resources – from national parks to forests and other environmental sites – is documented.” Such cases take a long time to investigate. Law enforcement often cannot access sites – many lie in combat zones, where most fires ignite, on mined land or in areas still under Russian occupation. The difficulty, Nikitin says, is establishing a cause-and-effect relationship proving that specific Russian military personnel were responsible for deliberately lit fires or targeting of emergency services. Anhelina Hrytsei, a researcher with the Ukrainian investigative group Truth Hounds, says reports of attacks on rescue workers intensified in 2024 and 2025. The precision of the weapons, absence of nearby military targets and repeated use of double-tap tactics point to deliberate targeting, she says. “If a small drone with a camera is used to attack rescue workers, and the operator can see them on site wearing insignia, then we can talk – if not about intent – at least about a failure to prevent harm.” Agriculture under threat Most large forest fires occur near active combat zones, where a variety of explosive objects litter the ground. Landmines and unexploded ordnance left from occupation or failed detonations can ignite in the heat, fuelling fires and making firefighting extremely dangerous. Russian forces also carry out remote mining, including anti-personnel mines known as “petals”, dropped from drones. “Once we demined this 8-hectare area near a road. A few days later, petals were already lying there,” says Skoryk. During hot, dry summers, the ammunition can heat and spontaneously detonate. The mines and ordnance also slow firefighting. In the frontline Izium Forestry, where about 90% of the territory remains mined, pyrotechnic units must inspect the area before crews can begin extinguishing. More than 2 million mines have been laid in Ukraine, making it one of the most mined countries in the world, and researchers say it will be difficult for the land to recover quickly. “Remaining mines and unexploded ordnances in forests along frontlines will prevent recovery and active reforestation of this land for a long time,” says Peter Potapov, a researcher at World Resource Institute’s Food, Forests and Water programme. Many of the country’s forests were planted and carefully managed alongside farmland, he says, to calm wind, hold snow and regulate water runoff. “Without these forests, the agricultural productivity may be reduced at the regional scale,” he says. Biodiversity shattered Burning at such enormous scale and intensity, the fires could have long-term effects on the biodiversity of Ukraine, scientists say. “War affects nature in a complex way – every part of the ecosystem suffers,” says ecologist Kateryna Polianska. “Some changes can be reversed, but others will not recover, or only with great difficulty.” In 2024, Polianska travelled to Sviati Hory national park and the Kreidova Flora department of the Ukrainian Steppe nature reserve, areas scarred by the war. There, relict chalk slopes – ancient formations created millions of years ago – were shattered by shelling. “We will no longer be able to reinforce them, put them up,” she says. These slopes once sheltered rare pine forests on chalk, recognised as an endangered habitat. Now, many forests lie burned, broken or stripped bare. Polianska warns that climate change makes recovery even harder: “It may take 70 or 80 years to see the same forest – if it recovers at all.” For Skoryk, the destruction is personal. The Kamianska Sich national park director lost his home when Russian forces occupied it in 2022 and he now lives in a basement on the park’s grounds. Despite everything, he refuses to leave. “This is my child, I created it – I have been the only director since the day it was founded,” Skoryk says. To him, the park is a life’s work, a place where rare species and fragile ecosystems depend on protection even under constant attack. Fires sparked by shelling regularly sweep through the park, threatening what remains. After the dust settles, craters maintain dangerous levels of heavy metals from explosives and toxins. Skoryk and his staff trained in mine clearance and continue to work on demining parts of the park whenever possible – between fires and after marked craters have been studied for measurements and samples. “If not us, who?” he says.

The shipments have enabled Russia to increase attacks against civilian targets, and there have been 20,000 containers of the gear transferred by Russian cargo ships, in violation of UN sanctions. The monitoring group comprises the US, South Korea, Japan, and eight other UN member states. It was set up after Russia and China cooperated to scrap an official security council panel that did the job. The multilateral group has said in its first ever report that Russia is helping North Korea improve its missiles’ guidance systems by sending back data from the battlefield. Moscow also provided air defence equipment, anti-aircraft missiles and electronic warfare systems to North Korea. “At least for the foreseeable future, North Korea and Russia intend to continue and further deepen their military cooperation in contravention of relevant UN security council resolutions.” After months of silence, North Korea and Russia confirmed in April that North Korean troops have been fighting on the Russian side in the Ukraine war. Russia’s SVR intelligence service has complained about Serbian ammunition ending up in Ukrainian hands via other countries when Moscow expects Belgrade’s “fraternal Slavic” obedience. The SVR alleges the trail leads to Ukraine through the Czech Republic, Poland and Bulgaria. Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vucic, told RTS television that he had discussed the exports with Vladimir Putin and the two countries would form a “working group” about it. But Vucic added that Serbia was criticised by both the east and west “because it leads autonomous and independent policies … Our factories must live and work. About 24,000 people work directly in the defence industry, and they depend on this industry.” Vucic has previously said that once the ammunition is sold to another country, he does not care where it goes next. At the United Nations, the US told the security council on Thursday that its proposal for a 30-day comprehensive ceasefire was “Russia’s best possible outcome” and Vladimir Putin should take it. “We want to work with Russia, including on this peace initiative and an economic package. There is no military solution to this conflict,” acting US ambassador John Kelley told the council. Russia is supposed to put forward a memorandum of its terms for peace but is refusing to do hand it over – demanding a further meeting with Ukraine, which says it has already sent its conditions. Kelley condemned Russia’s recent attacks on Ukraine as not demonstrating “a desire for peace”. “We will judge Russia’s seriousness towards ending the war, not only by the contents of that term sheet, but more importantly, by Russia’s actions … Additional sanctions on Russia are still on the table.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Russia was engaging in “yet another deception” by failing to hand over its peace settlement proposal ahead of their potential next meeting in Turkey on 2 June. “Even the so-called memorandum they promised and seemingly prepared for more than a week has still not been seen by anyone … despite promises to the contrary, first and foremost to the United States of America, to President Trump. Yet another Russian deception.” Ukraine’s foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said that without being able to review Russia’s memorandum, Kyiv would conclude “it is likely filled with unrealistic ultimatums, and they are afraid of revealing that they are stalling the peace process”. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan – president of Turkey which would again host the talks – called on Russia and Ukraine not to “shut the door” on dialogue. “The road to a resolution goes through more dialogue, more diplomacy. We are using all our diplomatic power and potential for peace,” he said, according to his office."
world/2025/feb/11/ukraine-war-briefing-biden-approved-weapons-still-flowing-says-kellogg,Ukraine war briefing: Power restrictions as Russia hits energy system,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/ukraine-war-briefing-biden-approved-weapons-still-flowing-says-kellogg,Ukraine war briefing: Power restrictions as Russia hits energy system,"Ukraine implemented emergency power restrictions on Tuesday morning as the energy minister, German Galushchenko, said a Russian attack on gas infrastucture was under way. A Ukrainian drone attack damaged an industrial facility in Russia’s southern region of Saratov, its governor said early on Tuesday. Ukraine’s Lt Col Andriy Kovalenko said it was the Saratov oil refinery that supplies the Russian army with fuel, but did not directly say it was the result of a Ukrainian attack. The Russian aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said it was suspending flights at the regional airport as well as those in Kazan, Ulyanovsk and Kirov. Donald Trump on Monday left open the possibility that Ukraine “may be Russian someday”, and called for trading US aid for Kyiv’s natural resources, such as rare minerals. “They may make a deal, they may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News. “But we are going to have all this money in there and I say I want it back.” Weapons approved under Joe Biden’s presidency are still flowing to Ukraine, the new US special envoy to Kyiv, Keith Kellogg, said on Monday. “There’s not necessarily any need in the next 24 hours to [do] it any different,” Kellogg said in an interview with the Reuters news agency. The Trump administration plans to push European allies to buy more American weapons for Ukraine – as they did under the Biden administration – ahead of potential peace talks with Moscow, Reuters has reported, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. Kellogg will discuss this with European allies this week during the Munich security conference, which begins on Friday, Reuters said, citing its sources. The development, if confirmed, may be reassuring to Ukrainian leaders that the flow of arms will continue. Kellogg declined to confirm the plan to Reuters but said: “The US always likes selling weapons made in America because it strengthens our economy. There are a lot of options out there. Everything is in play right now.” It is believed that administration officials view an arms purchase deal with Europe as a potential workaround, allowing Washington to support Kyiv without spending US taxpayer dollars. The Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, has said Europe would pay for US arms for Ukraine. On the potential for peace talks, Kellogg told Reuters: “I wouldn’t say we’re at the beginning of the [peace planning process] because we’ve been thinking through it,” adding that US officials in Munich would “deliver our expectations to the allies … More importantly, we want to hear from them”. Donald Trump on Monday confirmed that Kellogg would soon visit Ukraine. A source in the Ukrainian president’s office told Agence France-Presse that Kellogg would arrive in Ukraine on 20 February. Zelenskyy spokesperson Sergiy Nikiforov told AFP that Ukraine’s president would meet with the US vice-president, JD Vance, on Friday on the sidelines of the Munich conference. The pro-Russian separatist region of Moldova, Transnistria, rejected on Monday a new European gas offer despite experiencing a severe energy crisis since Gazprom deliveries via Ukraine stopped. Separatist leadership said the region would instead take Russia-financed gas transported from Hungary, which receives gas from Russia via the Turkstream pipeline through Turkey. Moldova has criticised the whole affair as a destabilisation tactic by Russia. “The European Union’s offer was a solution to free the territory from blackmail and energy instability” but “Russia won’t allow it to accept European aid because it is scared of losing control” of the territory, said the Moldovan prime minister, Dorin Recean."

Before he left Washington, Trump said on Friday that he is looking at secondary sanctions on Russia amid the war in Ukraine. Von der Leyen said later she would meet Trump in Scotland on Sunday. British officials have been heartened by what they see as a clear shift in Trump’s rhetoric on Ukraine and Russia in recent weeks. The United States told China at the United Nations on Friday it should “stop fuelling Russia’s aggression” in Ukraine, as China accused Washington of trying to shift blame and spark confrontation. Acting US Ambassador to the UN Dorothy Shea urged all countries, specifically naming China, to stop exports to Russia of dual-use goods that Washington says contribute to Russia’s war industrial base and enable its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. China’s deputy UN Ambassador Geng Shuang responded it is not a party to the conflict, has never provided lethal weapons, and has always “strictly controlled dual-use materials, including the export of drones”. The Kremlin said on Friday that a summit between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy could only happen as a final step to seal a peace deal. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that it was unlikely that such a meeting could occur by the end of August, as Ukraine has proposed. Ukraine says a leaders’ meeting is required in order to achieve a breakthrough in the slow-moving process, which has seen the two sides hold three brief sessions of peace talks in Turkey since mid-May. In comments to journalists, Zelenskyy said Russia had begun to engage over the possibility of such a meeting. Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday toured a factory producing interceptor drones, increasingly seen as a solution to protecting Ukrainian cities from Russian air attacks, and said a goal had been set to make up to 1,000 of the weapons each day. Zelenskyy, speaking in his nightly video address, said newly appointed defence minister Denys Shmyhal had reported on foreign assistance that would enable Ukraine to “ensure a reliable flow of weapons for Ukrainian soldiers.” Civilian casualties in Ukraine are on rise as Moscow has deployed a nightly blitz of drones, decoys, cruise and ballistic missiles – increasingly aimed at a single city or location. “A plan has been approved to reach production of 500-1,000 interceptor drones per day. The deadline has been set,” said Zelenskyy. Ukraine has received confirmation from partners that they will provide funding for three Patriot missile defence systems and discussions are under way to finance seven more, Zelenskyy said: “I have officially received confirmation from Germany for two systems, and from Norway for one. We are currently working with Dutch partners.” Ukraine’s top anti-corruption investigator said on Friday that he did not expect attempts to derail his agency’s work to end, despite an abrupt U-turn by Zelenskyy on curbing their independence that fuelled rare protests. Semen Kryvonos said he was taken aback by attempts this week to curtail his agency’s fight against graft. He spoke a day after Zelenskyy sought to defuse tensions by submitting legislation restoring the independence of NABU and its sister agency, the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO). Thousands of protesters took part in protests in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities this week after lawmakers fast-tracked a bill granting a Zelenskyy-appointed general prosecutor power over the two bodies. Kryvonos applauded Zelenskiy’s reversal, but said NABU and SAPO remain a high-priority target for vested interests aiming to stymie their closely watched efforts to clean up. Zelenskyy says Ukrainian forces are facing fierce fighting around the city of Pokrovsk in the east, a logistics hub near which Russia has been announcing the capture of villages on an almost daily basis. Russia’s defence ministry on Thursday announced the capture of two villages on either side of Pokrovsk – Zvirove to the west and Novoekonomichne to the east. A third village near the city – Novotoretske – was declared by Moscow to be “liberated” earlier in the week. Ukrainian officials have made no acknowledgment that the villages have changed hands. Zelenskyy also said Ukrainian forces were also “continuing to act” in border areas in the northern Sumy region, where Russian troops have gained a foothold in recent weeks. In Sumy, where Russian troops are trying to establish what Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin calls a “buffer zone”, the popular Ukrainian military blog DeepState said Kyiv’s forces had retaken a previously lost village. DeepState said Ukrainian troops had restored control over the village of Kindrativka. There was no official comment from either side. SpaceX’s Starlink satellite network was back up and running on Friday as engineers hunted for the root cause of one of its biggest international outages the night before, a rare disruption for the powerful internet system set off by an internal software failure. In Ukraine, where troops rely heavily on Starlink for battlefield communications, the outage affected combat operations as service was “down across the entire front,” said Robert Brovdi, the commander of Ukraine’s drone forces."

Novo Nordisk’s decision to cut 11% of its global workforce of 78,400 is an attempt by the new chief executive, Mike Doustdar, to revive its fortunes. Sales of its blockbuster injection Wegovy have slowed sharply as it has lost ground to Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro jabs, as well as cheaper versions by generic drugmakers, while the pharmaceutical sector faces the threat of targeted US tariffs. The drugmaker said that 5,000 of the job losses would be in its home country of Denmark. The share price rose by 2.1% by Wednesday afternoon as investors were cheered by the cost savings Booming sales of GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs in recent years had helped Novo Nordisk rise to become Europe’s most valuable company, but it lost the title in March, only briefly regaining it in June. Studies have shown that Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro is more effective than Wegovy in reducing weight. Both can be prescribed by NHS doctors to patients with high clinical need. Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic injection is also available on the NHS, as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. It can be prescribed by private doctors “off label” for weight loss. Donald Trump has asked the EU to impose tariffs of up to 100% on India and China as part of an effort to force the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to end the war in Ukraine, according to reports. The US president made the demand during a meeting between US and EU officials discussing options to increase economic pressure on Russia on Tuesday, according to the Financial Times, BBC and Bloomberg, who cited sources familiar with the discussions. One US official reportedly said that Trump administration was “ready to go, ready to go right now, but we are only going to do this if our European partners step up with us”. Trump’s proposal comes amid his frustration at brokering a peace deal, including at a high-profile summit with Putin in Alaska, and amid Russia’s increasing drone attacks, including its largest ever air attack on Ukraine last week. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has called for a suspension of trade with Israel, as she spoke of Europe’s “painful” inability to respond to the war on Gaza and ensuing humanitarian disaster. In her most extended condemnation yet of the Israeli government, von der Leyen criticised plans for illegal settlements that would split the occupied West Bank in half, as well as incitement of violence by extremist Israeli ministers, as a “clear attempt to undermine the two-state solution”. She made the remarks during her annual “state of the union” speech to the European parliament in Strasbourg, in which she depicted a turbulent world where battle lines “are being drawn” and “dependencies are ruthlessly weaponised”. In response to Russia’s overnight violations of Polish airspace, she said Europe “stands in full solidarity with Poland”, a line prompting MEPs to their feet applauding in support. Von der Leyen continued, calling for Europe to exert more pressure on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to come to the negotiating table. Our other main stories: Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow with the latest news. Take care – JK Wall Street indices have hit record highs after a jump in Oracle shares, and weaker-than-expected producer price inflation data cemented expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. The S&amp;P 500 index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both rose to intra-day all-time highs. The Oracle share price surged by 37% to a record high of $339.69, and was set for its biggest one-day percentage gain since 1992, after the company announced that it expected booked revenue at its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business to exceed half a trillion dollars. Some chipmakers also rose on the news, with Nvidia climbing by 3.8%, Advanced Micro Devices up 3.3% and Broadcom adding 8.9%. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and TikTok have won a legal challenge against the regulatory fees they are charged under European Union’s digital content rules. Big tech, and Donald Trump, have chafed against the EU’s new tech regulations including the digital services act (DSA), which requires strict policing of their platforms. Facebook parent Meta and Chinese-owned TikTok have taken on the DSA by suing the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, over their required contribution to the cost of complying with the act. They argued that the supervisory fee of 0.05% of their annual worldwide net income was based on a flawed calculation and resulted in disproportionate fees. The Luxembourg-based General Court sided with Meta and TikTok, giving European Union regulators 12 months to fix their methodology using a different legal act. Judges said: That methodology... should have been adopted not in the context of implementing decisions but in a delegated act, in accordance with the rules laid down in the DSA. They said regulators need not repay the 2023 fees paid by the companies for now, while they come up with a new legal basis for the methodology used to determine the size of the fee. The Commission said the court had confirmed that its fee methodology is sound and sees no issue with the principle of the fee nor the amount. TikTok and Meta welcomed the court’s decision, with the US company saying it looked forward to “the flaws in the methodology being addressed’. Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief executive, has criticised EU tech regulation this year, warning that Europe “has an ever increasing number of laws institutionalising censorship and making it difficult to build anything innovative there”. The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, denied Zuckerberg’s claim, saying “we absolutely refute any claims of censorship”. Geoff Cooper, chair of electrical appliance retailer AO, has been named as the new chair of Channel 4, as the broadcaster faces huge head winds in a fast-changing media world. His appointment comes at a time of huge change for Channel 4, which is already looking for a new chief executive after the departure of Alex Mahon. Cooper’s first major task will be to find her replacement. He will have to do so with Channel 4 having to battle huge changes in media consumption that has seen audiences move away from linear TV and towards both streaming services, like Netflix and Disney, and digital platforms like YouTube. The upheaval has created serious challenges for Channel 4, which is reliant on an advertising market that has fragmented and turned its attention towards digital platforms. Channel 4 is publicly owned, while being commercially funded. Cooper takes over from Sir Ian Cheshire, who stepped down this year. Channel 4 insiders had wanted to see the chair position go to Dawn Airey, who is currently acting as an interim chair. However, she did not run for the post. Sources close to the company believe this was down to her previous clashes with Michael Grade, chair of media regulator Ofcom who drew up the shortlist of candidates. Cooper does not have a background in television, but does have extensive boardroom experience. He is a former chief executive of builders’ merchant Travis Perkins. He also held posts at the retailers Dunelm and Card Factory and the food wholesaler Brakes. US producer prices unexpectedly fell last month, suggesting Donald Trump’s trade tariff effects are “feeding through only slowly,” according to an economist. The producer price index, which captures factory gate inflation before it hits consumers, showed that wholesale inflation dipped by 0.1% in August from July, after advancing 0.7% month-on-month in July, according to data from the US Labor Department. The drop in producer prices makes it even more likely that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate next week for the first time this year. Wholesale services prices fell on smaller profit margins at retailers and wholesalers, which might be a sign that those companies are absorbing the cost of Donald Trump’s sweeping trade tariffs. Compared to a year earlier, producer prices were up by 2.6%. The core measure, excluding food and energy which can be volatile, also fell by 0.1% in August from the previous month, while economists had expected a 0.3% gain. Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capita Economics, said: The downside surprise to the PPI in August was driven by a compression of trade margins, reversing their unexpected widening in July, and therefore overstates the softness of producer prices. Nonetheless, the big picture remains that tariff effects are feeding through only slowly… There is little for the Fed to worry about in terms of the PPI components that feed into the core PCE [personal consumption expenditures] deflator, which were on the whole in line with their averages in recent months. Accordingly, ahead of the more important consumer prices index release tomorrow, our preliminary estimate is that the core PCE deflator rose by 0.25% month on month. That would be above the target-consistent rate of roughly 0.17% m/m and might, at the margin at least, quell talk of a 50bp [interest rate] cut next week. The newly appointed business secretary, Peter Kyle, is in Beijing for the UK’s first trade talks with the country in seven years in an attempt to revitalise economic relations. As part of a two day programme he held a bilateral with Li Lecheng, the minister of industry and information technology on Wednesday morning as part of a revived industrial cooperation dialogue, a Sino-British relationship format that has not sat since 2022. The ministry is responsible for industrial policy but also telecoms and the internet, which is heavily censored in China. Tomorow Kyle, who was only promoted to the post on Friday, will have a day long programme with China’s long-standing commerce minister Wang Wentao including a bilateral in the morning, followed by a meeting of the UK-China Joint Economic and Trade Commission (Jetco) which has not sat for seven years. It will end with a joint dinner where the ministers will be joined by Chinese and British businesses. Kyle is the ninth government representative to visit China since Labour were elected to power last year with hopes that the trip will unlock an export market worth more than £1bn over five years, according to a statement from the department for business and trade. Restarting trade talks with China was “an essential tool to put money into people’s pockets,” said Kyle. More discussions and direct engagement with China will ensure trade between us can flourish, strengthen our national security, and create space to raise concerns constructively where needed. Ahead of the Jetco meeting, the department for business and trade (DBT) unveiled new deals and market openings for British interests worth £2bn. These include a new three-season TV deal for the Premier League and marketing opportunities for companies ranging from Eve Lom cosmetics to Hayman’s gin distillery and Aedas architecture firm which has previously been involved in buildings such as Kong Kong’s West Kowloon rail station and the giant Sina Plaza science park in Beijing. The department also pointed to China being a “huge market” for British cars and for porcine genetics, a pig breeding programme, cattle hides and sheep skins. The UK is looking to China to achieve much-needed economic growth but so far the trading relationship does not reflect the size of the country. Sam Goodman, senior policy director at Chinese Strategic Risks Institute, said: The export wins DBT secured in the last year with China and Hong Kong accounts less 0.2% of total annual UK exports. While the new deals themselves account to just £200m a year, from the second largest economy in the world. Keir Starmer is tightening his grip on economic policy by beefing up a committee that will help shape the 26 November budget. Pensions minister Torsten Bell and Starmer’s new chief economic adviser, Minouche Shafik, will co-chair the “budget board”, that will meet weekly to discuss the details of the statement. Government sources said the meetings were aimed at ensuring No 10 and No 11 were aligned and that there was not a repeat of the backlash from businesses that followed Rachel Reeves’s maiden budget. Starmer has looked to increase his grip on economic policy in recent weeks, by appointing Shafiq, poaching Reeves’s No 2, Darren Jones, and appointing a longtime Treasury civil servant to be his principal private secretary. The cyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover has affected data held by the carmaker, it has said, as its factories in the UK and abroad face prolonged closure. JLR, Britain’s biggest carmaker, said on Wednesday that in its investigations into the hack, which first emerged last week, it had now discovered data had been breached. The manufacturer said it could not provide more details of which data was affected, or if customers’ or suppliers’ information was stolen, but said it would be contacting anyone affected. A spokesperson said all the relevant authorities had been notified, understood to include the Information Commissioner’s Office, which had already been informed of the risk of a data breach. Shares in Oracle have jumped by nearly 32% before the opening bell on Wall Street, after the business software company got a big boost from its cloud computing business. The Austin, Texas-based company forecast that revenue from its core cloud division will exceed half a trillion dollars over the next few months. Investors have been betting big on AI-driven cloud firms. Oracle’s rivals are seeing rapid cloud growth as well, reflecting how rising enterprise demand for AI infrastructure is fuelling a broader lift across the industry. The results lifted shares of several US chipmakers in pre-market trading, with AMD up around 3% and Nvidia 2.2% higher. Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: Oracle shares soared amid optimism about AI-related revenue, sending a strong message to the broader market that the tech revolution is still red hot. That had a positive read-across to Nvidia which advanced 2% in pre-market trading. Oracle said on Tuesday that it had signed four multi-billion-dollar contracts with three customers in the first quarter, signalling booming demand for its low-cost cloud infrastructure services. Chief executive Safra Catz said: Over the next few months, we expect to sign-up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers and RPO is likely to exceed half-a-trillion dollars. The company forecast Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) revenue growth of 77% to $18bn this year, and $144bn in the following four years. Analysts at the research firm Morningstar said: Oracle’s relationship with esteemed artificial intelligence firms, such as OpenAI, as well as its participation in Stargate, puts it center stage for AI training and inference workloads. The company has struck deals with Amazon, Google owner Alphabet and Microsoft to run OCI within their clouds, with revenue from these clients up 1,529% in the first quarter. Oracle expects second-quarter revenue to rise by 12%-14%, including cloud revenue growth of between 32% and 36%. An estimated 64.5% of adult Brits are overweight or living with obesity, yet more than 71% (48 million people) say weight loss injections are out of reach. Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro drugs are available on the NHS, but are limited to people with high clinical need. Now, with Mounjaro prices surging by up to 170% in the UK, some patients, who buy the drug privately, will be paying nearly three times more for their treatment. Mounjaro users reacted with dismay to when its manufacturer, Eli Lilly, announced a price increase in the UK from September, as we reported last month. Many people are worried they will be unable to continue using the medication, raising concerns for their mental and physical health. But even before the price hikes, affordability was an issue. A survey by the online pharmacy ZAVA showed that 49% of Brits (nearly 33 million people) can only afford to spend up to £80 a month, far below Mounjaro’s new £170–£310 range. With Wegovy’s highest dose (2.4mg) now capped at £189.99, a steep price but experts say it could offer a more accessible option for patients than Mounjaro Dr. Crystal Wyllie, ZAVA doctor, said: We’re seeing record interest in these drugs, but price and strict NHS eligibility criteria mean many are left without safe, regulated access. Cheaper alternatives like Wegovy can help, but ongoing support is key. Here’s our full story on Wegovy and Ozempic maker Novo Nordisk making job cuts as it struggles against competition from Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro jab and cheaper generic versions: It comes as a UN report found that more children around the world are obese than underweight for the first time – a sad milestone. It warned that ultra-processed junk food is overwhelming childhood diets. There are 188 million teenagers and school-age children with obesity – one in 10 – Unicef said, affecting health and development and bringing a risk of life-threatening diseases. Catherine Russell, executive director of the UN agency for children, said: When we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children. Obesity is a growing concern. Ultra-processed food [UPF] is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children’s growth, cognitive development and mental health. While 9.2% of five to 19-year-olds worldwide are underweight, 9.4% are considered obese, the report found. In 2000, nearly 13% were underweight and just 3% were obese. About 1m households are behind on their gas and electricity bills with no repayment plan amid a rise in energy debt over the past decade, according to a new report. The Resolution Foundation thinktank found that the number of customers in energy debt has increased and the size of their debts has risen. It found that between 2012 and 2024 the average gas and electricity debts more than doubled to £1,400 and £1,600, respectively, from an average of approximately £500. The number of customers behind on their electricity bills, with no repayment plan, has more than tripled from 300,000 in 2012 to more than 1m at the end of last year, the report found. The number of customers who are behind on their gas bills also tripled from 300,000 to 900,000 over the same period. Contactless card payments could go above £100 and potentially become unlimited under proposals to allow banks and other providers to set their own limits for customers. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said on Wednesday that the proposal to scrap the current limit would provide shoppers with more convenience and card providers “the flexibility to decide the right limit for them and customers”. The UK financial watchdog has been consulting on giving banks the option of raising or removing the £100 cap, which would mean shoppers no longer need to enter a four-digit pin to authorise big purchases, since March. Customers are also currently unable to make more than £300 of touch-free payments in a single day. Ciarán Cuffe, co chair of the European Green Party, said he was heartened to hear Ursula von der Leyen make an unexpected return to the narrative of the green deal. After a year or more of pressure from centre right and far right political interests to abandon environmental targets, von der Leyen, president of the European Commission in Brussels, told MEPs: We must stay the course on our environmental goals. This is a must. Cuffe told the Guardian: It was good to hear her mention the European green deal because she has tended to use the phrase clean industrial deal ad nauseam in the past year, so it was good to hear her going back to the ‘green deal’. She is obviously under pressure to from the EPP [European People’s Party], including from chancellor Merz looking for flexibility for the car industry, but it was very interesting to hear her call for small affordable cars. If we don’t do that Asia will win the race to go electric. Luca de Meo, the former boss of car giant Stellantis, has previously called on Europe to follow the Japanese example to make what is known as “Kei cars” – a distinct class of small cars which come with incentives such as reduced taxes and parking costs. But yesterday the German chancellor Friederich Merz weighed in on the side of the Germany car industry, urging Brussels to consider “flexibility” around the 2035 target for phasing out the sale of new petrol cars. This set Germany up for a clash with Nordic brands Polestar and Volvo, which say they should not be punished just because the Germans have been slow to adopt to change. In financial markets, the FTSE 100 index of leading UK shares is broadly flat at 9,250, up by 8.7 points. The German and French stock markets edged by 0.1% higher, while the Italian borsa slipped by 0.17%. The Russian rouble fell to a five-month low against the US dollar, crossing the 85 rouble mark, after drones from Moscow’s attack in western Ukraine were shot down in Polish airspace. The rouble fell by 1.6% to 84 against the dollar at one stage. It has lost 5% against the dollar since the start of the week. Analysts pointed to an expected interest rate cut by the Russian central bank on 12 September, rising demand for imports and the threat of new western sanctions on Moscow. Bank of St Petersburg analysts said: Fears of sanctions, coupled with expectations of a rate cut, continue to put pressure on the Russian currency. Russia’s attack on Ukraine spread to Nato territory in the most significant way since the full-scale invasion more than three years ago. You can follow the latest on our Europe live blog here: The fashion company behind Zara has reported weaker-than-expected sales after a slowdown in growth at the retail chain. The boss of Inditex, the world’s largest fashion retailer, insisted it reported a “solid” performance in the face of “complex” market conditions. Inditex said sales picked up in recent weeks after the launch of its autumn and winter collections, which were “very well received by our customers”. The Galicia-based retailer, which also owns the Pull &amp; Bear and Bershka brands, said sales grew by 1.6% to €18.4bn (£15.9bn) in the six months to July. Sales were up 5.1% after adjusting for currency rates. Sales of €10.08bn in the second quarter came in below the €10.26bn expected by analysts. Sales for the group’s flagship Zara business grew slightly to €13.15bn, however this was a slowdown, amid pressure on household finances. Inditex reported a pick up in sales more recently, with 9% growth across its stores and online between 1 August 1 and 7 September. Oscar Garcia Maceiras, chief executive of Inditex, said: We have again achieved a solid performance in this first half of 2025, with satisfactory sales in a complex market environment and keeping strong levels of profitability. The efficient execution accomplished by our teams demonstrates the strength of Inditex’s business model. Separately on Wednesday, Primark owner Associated British Foods said like-for-like sales in the second half would be 2% below the same period last year, amid “consumer caution”. It flagged a “more subdued consumer environment in Europe and trading was weaker, while performance in the US was strong”. Over the year as a whole, the company expects Primark’s like-for-like sales growth to be around 1%, with its store rollout programme driving total sales growth of around 4%. Anthony Codling, housing analyst at RBC Europe, said: PRS [private rented sector housing] investors continue to drive a hard bargain leading to tough decisions on volumes versus margins. We continue to believe that an investment in Vistry is a big call on the speed and scale of deployment of public sector funding, so far it has been a trickle rather than a torrent, with £150m out of £39bn coming Vistry’s way. We expect that figure to grow over time, but we cannot say by when and by how much. If the government does look to stimulate the open housing market, Vistry, with a focus on social and affordable homes, will not benefit as much as the more traditional mainstream housebuilders, who in our view offer a more attractive valuation, yield and risk profile. Shares in Vistry Group, one of Britain’s biggest housebuilders, plunged after its first-half profits more than halved. The company, which owns Bovis Homes, Countryside and Linden Homes, said its pre-tax profit in the first six months of the year fell to £40.9m from £91.2m a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, profits fell by a third to £80.6m. It completed 6,889 homes, down 12% from the 7,792 completed a year earlier. Revenues fell by 5% to £1.6bn. Vistry shares fell as much as 8% to 555p, and are now down 3.7%. However, Vistry was upbeat, after forming a long-term joint venture with the UK’s housing agency earlier this week. Homes England and the company have created a new vehicle, called Hestia, backed by a combined £150m of capital investment. Last year, the government pledged to build 1.5m homes in this parliament, over five years, with a focus on social and affordable housing. In June, then-housing secretary Angela Rayner announced a massive boost to the government’s affordable housing programme, almost doubling funding to £39bn over the next decade. Greg Fitzgerald, the Vistry chief executive, said: The new social affordable homes programme provides an unprecedented level of funding for affordable housing over the next 10 years. Through our partnership model and commitment to mixed tenure development, Vistry is uniquely placed to maximise this opportunity and play a key role in delivering high-quality affordable homes across the country. Vistry now specialises in building social and affordable homes for its partners. The company pre-sells at least 50% of new homes on its developments to housing associations, local authorities, and private rented sector providers. The news comes after the US supreme court agreed on Tuesday to decide the legality of Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs, setting up a major test of one of the Republican president’s boldest assertions of executive power that has been central to his economic and trade agenda. The justices took up the justice department’s appeal of a lower court’s ruling that Trump overstepped his authority in imposing most of his tariffs under a federal law meant for emergencies. The court acted swiftly after the administration last week asked it to review the case, which involves trillions of dollars in customs duties over the next decade. The court, which begins its next nine-month term on 6 October, placed the case on a fast track, scheduling oral arguments for the first week of November. The justices also agreed to hear a separate challenge to Trump’s tariffs brought by a family-owned toy company, Learning Resources. The US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington ruled on 29 August that Trump overreached in invoking a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the tariffs, undercutting a major priority for the president in his second term. The tariffs, however, remain in effect during the appeal to the supreme court. More on the proposed Trump tariffs on India and China. According to the Financial Times, a second US official said Washington was prepared to “mirror” any tariffs on China and India imposed by the EU, potentially leading to a further increase in US levies on imports from both countries. Trump’s proposal comes as the White House is getting frustrated with its efforts at brokering a peace deal and Russia’s recent heavy aerial attacks on Ukraine. “The president came on this morning and his view is that the obvious approach here is, let’s all put on dramatic tariffs and keep the tariffs on until the Chinese agree to stop buying the oil. There really aren’t many other places that oil can go,” the first US official said. The US president later told reporters he expected to have a call with Russian president Vladimir Putin “this week or early next week”. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Donald Trump has reportedly asked the EU to levy tariffs of up to 100% on India and China, in order to increase pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine. The US president made the demand after he dialled into a meeting on Tuesday between senior US and EU officials gathered in Washington, the Financial Times, Bloomberg News and other media reported. One US official said, according to the FT: We’re ready to go, ready to go right now, but we’re only going to do this if our European partners step up with us. Meanwhile, Ozempic and Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk announced that it will cut 9,000 jobs and trimmed its profit forecast for this year, as it struggles against competition from US rival Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro weight loss injection. The job cuts amount to 11% of the drugmaker’s workforce of 78,400. About 5,000 of the job losses will happen in Denmark. Novo Nordisk said the move would save 8bn Danish kroner (£930m) a year, although it will also lead to one-off costs of 8bn kroner this year. As a result, it expects to deliver operating profit growth of 4% to 10% at constant exchange rates, down from 10%—16%. It is the first major move by Mike Doustdar, an Iranian-born Austrian-American businessman, who took over as chief executive last month. Novo Nordisk – which had become Europe’s most valuable company on the back of the weight loss drug boom – recently lost two thirds of its market value following disappointing drug trial results and slowing sales. Doustdar said: As the global leader in obesity and diabetes, Novo Nordisk delivers life-changing products for patients worldwide. But our markets are evolving, particularly in obesity, as it has become more competitive and consumer- driven. Our company must evolve as well. It is always difficult to see talented and valued colleagues go, but we are convinced that this is the right thing to do for the long-term success of Novo Nordisk. We need a shift in our mindset and approach so we can be faster and more agile. Our transformation plan is designed to deliver this. Studies have shown that Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro is more effective than Wegovy in reducing weight. Novo’s Ozempic injection is also available on the NHS, as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Asian stock markets rose while government bonds fell, after weaker US labour market data heightened expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut of at least a quarter point next week. Japan’s Nikkei closed 0.87% higher while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbed by 1.1% and South Korea’s Kospi rose by 1.67%. US government bonds fell for a second day on Wednesday, pushing yields higher. The yield, or interest rate, on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose by 1 basis point to 4.088%, after climbing almost 3 basis points on Tuesday. The equivalent Japanese bond yield rose by 0.5 basis points to 1.565%.

world/2025/oct/18/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-realistic-about-chances-of-tomahawk-missile-deal,Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy ‘realistic’ about chances of Tomahawk missile deal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/18/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-realistic-about-chances-of-tomahawk-missile-deal,Ukraine war briefing: Zelenskyy ‘realistic’ about chances of Tomahawk missile deal,"Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Ukraine needs American long-range missiles for an offensive against Russian targets but that he was “realistic” about his chances of getting them. The Ukrainian president was speaking after talks with Donald Trump at the White House on Friday during which the US president appeared cool on the prospect of supplying Kyiv with Tomahawk missiles. However, in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press,” Zelenskyy suggested the door was not entirely closed. “It’s good that President Trump didn’t say ‘no,’ but for today, didn’t say ‘yes,’” he said. Zelenskyy added that Ukraine needed Tomahawks because “it’s very difficult just to operate only with Ukrainian drones.” After the meeting, Trump implored the combatants to “stop the war immediately”, even if it means Ukraine conceding territory. “Stop the killing. And that should be it,” he told journalists after arriving in Florida. On social media he suggested freezing the conflict, saying: “They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide!” When asked about the social media post, which he had not seen, Zelenskyy said: “The president is right we have to stop where we are, and then to speak.” Zelenskyy had what British prime minister Sir Keir Starmer described as a “productive” call with European leaders on Friday, hours after Zelenskyy met Trump at the White House. “I shared details of my conversation with US president Donald Trump. We discussed many important issues,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X. “The main priority now is to protect as many lives as possible, guarantee security for Ukraine, and strengthen all of us in Europe. That is exactly what we are working for. Our national security advisers will discuss the next steps. We are coordinating our positions. I am grateful for the conversation, for all the support, and for the readiness to stand with Ukraine.” Starmer reiterated the UK’s “unwavering commitment to Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression”, and said it would “continue to send humanitarian aid and military support” to Kyiv. Leaders from Germany, Finland, Italy, Norway, and Poland were on the call, along with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Nato Secretary Gen Mark Rutte and European council president Antonio Costa. Russia and the US should build a “Putin-Trump” rail tunnel under the Bering Strait to link their countries, unlock joint exploration of natural resources and “symbolise unity“, a Kremlin envoy has suggested. The proposal by Kirill Dmitriev, President Vladimir Putin’s investment envoy and head of Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, envisages a construction project costing US$8bn (£6bn), funded by Moscow and “international partners”, to build a 70-mile (112-km) rail and cargo link in under eight years. Dmitriev floated the idea late on Thursday after Putin spoke to Donald Trump by phone and agreed to meet in Budapest to discuss stopping the war against Ukraine. The Russian Defence Ministry said on Friday its forces had taken control of three more villages in eastern Ukraine, one in the Dnipropetrovsk region and two in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, closer to the Russian border. Ukraine has acknowledged fighting around at least two of the settlements but has not said that any of the areas have changed hands. According to the Russian ministry, Moscow’s troops took control of Pryvillia in the Dnipropetrovsk region, and captured the villages of Pishchane and Tykhe."

His bank was experiencing only “very modest” growth due to “challenging macroeconomic conditions” including a shrinkage of its consumer loan portfolio, while 2025 growth was worse thank the bank expected. “Gref’s statements are notable,” the ISW assessed, “as Russian officials have largely refrained from admitting to any weakness in Russia’s economy and as the Kremlin has undertaken an information campaign to portray the Russian economy as stable and strong.” Ukraine’s top military commander, Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Tuesday that the army’s situation had “significantly worsened” in parts of the Zaporizhzhia region amid fierce fighting with Russian forces. “In the Oleksandrivka and Huliapole directions … using its numerical superiority in personnel and materiel, the enemy advanced in fierce fighting and captured three settlements,” Syrskyi posted. The ISW, in its most recent assessment at time of writing, reported on advances in the area – both unconfirmed gains proclaimed by Russian sources, and others confirmed by geolocation of video footage. Ukraine’s military said it struck a Russian oil refinery in the city of Orsk in Russia’s Orenburg region on Tuesday. “Explosions and a fire have been observed on the premises. According to preliminary information, one of the primary oil processing units has been hit,” the statement said. Nato member Romania found drone fragments on its territory near the south-eastern border region after Russian strikes on Ukrainian Danube River ports, authorities said on Tuesday. Drones were earlier detected near Romanian and Nato airspace, said the defence ministry. The foreign minister, Oana Toiu, said: “These actions are part of a series of similar incidents and represent a characteristic of the war of aggression waged by Russia. This is also reflected in Russia’s systematic provocations against the EU and Nato.” Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was “ready” to discuss with Washington accusations by Donald Trump that Russia had carried out secret underground nuclear tests. “We are ready to discuss the suspicions raised by our American colleagues regarding the possibility that we might be secretly doing something deep underground,” Russia’s recently reclusive foreign minister told state media in a televised interview. He denied it and said the US could check whether Russia tested a nuclear warhead via the global seismic monitoring system. “Other tests, both subcritical, or those without a chain nuclear reaction, and carrier tests, have never been prohibited,” Lavrov said. Russian interests were negotiating their withdrawal from key Serbian oil company NIS which now faces US sanctions, Serbia’s energy minister said on Tuesday. Russia’s Gazprom Neft and its owner Gazprom have held nearly 45% of NIS since 2009. Gazprom recently transferred about 11% to another Russian firm, Intelligence. The Serbian state has just under 30%. Serbian officials feared that continued Russian control of NIS could harm Serbia’s economy. NIS runs Serbia’s main refinery at Pancevo near Belgrade which supplies about 80% of the country’s needs. The knock-on effects of the US sanctions on Russian oil companies have upended Russian investments in several countries. The head of Ukraine’s delegation for talks with Russia said on Tuesday he was in Istanbul to try to “unblock” the process of prisoner swaps, and that he would have more meetings in the Middle East on the issue. “There was an agreement – and it must be implemented,” said Rustem Umerov, who is also the secretary of Ukraine’s security council. Ukraine will increase power import capacity from neighbouring countries to a total of 2,300MW in December, the head of the state grid operator said on Tuesday, without elaborating on how this would be achieved. Vitaliy Zaichenko told a press conference that current capacity was 2,100MW but Ukraine was not able to use it all owing to limitations in the system. Ukraine’s prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said the government had dismissed Energoatom’s supervisory board while anti-corruption authorities said they had charged seven individuals over an alleged $100m kickback scheme involving the nuclear agency and other state enterprises. Energoatom, which generates more than a half of Ukraine’s energy supply, said the probe had not disrupted production or operational safety. A Ukrainian man accused by German prosecutors of involvement in the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline blasts has ended a hunger strike he began on 31 October after Italian authorities pledged to give him food meeting his medical requirements, his lawyer said on Tuesday. The detainee, identified under German privacy laws as Serhii K, has said he suffers from pancreatitis and coeliac disease and is vegan. He denies any role in the explosions that severed Russian gas supplies to Europe, and is appealing against extradition to Germany. Britain plans to ban companies from providing services such as shipping and insurance for Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. The EU has approved sanctions that ban Russian LNG imports from 1 January 2027 but the UK government said on Tuesday it wanted to go further. “The ban will be phased in over 2026 in lockstep with our European partners,” said the British Foreign Office."

On the Telegram messaging app, the military’s general staff said those injured included servicemen undergoing treatment in the medical centre. It accused Russia of having carried out a “war crime” and of “violating the norms of international humanitarian law” denouncing the “deliberate, targeted shelling” of the facility. Oleh Syniehubov, the regional governor, said 25 people were hurt, including a 15-year-old girl who is in serious condition. An hour before the Kharkiv attack, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine expected a strong response from western countries to the near daily Russian drone attacks on its territory. Earlier, drones hit the south-eastern city of Dnipro, killing four people, and the central city of Kryvyi Rih, where nine others were injured. “We expect a response, a serious response. We are working to ensure there is a strong reaction, especially from America, Europe and all those in the world who rely on diplomacy,” said Zelenskyy. He said that Russia’s response to US ceasefire efforts had been inadequate “for too long”, and that Moscow needed to be pressured into a peace deal. Zelenskyyalso said Russia had launched more than 170 drones into Ukraine overnight, striking targets in the Dnipropetrovsk, Kyiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, and Khmelnytskyi regions. He said that Ukraine was “maintaining active measures” to prevent Russia from advancing into Sumy and Kharkiv regions, and that that Ukrainian forces had taken “certain steps” in Russia outside the Kursk region to ease pressure on Ukrainian troops in the area. Russia on Saturday claimed the capture of two villages in eastern and southern Ukraine, pressing ahead with its advance amid stumbling efforts for a ceasefire. The defence ministry said Moscow’s forces captured the village of Shchebraki in the southern Zaporizhzhia region and Panteleimonivka in the eastern Donetsk region. Russian forces also captured the settlement of Veselivka in Ukraine’s northeastern Sumy region, Russian state-run news agency Tass reported on Saturday, citing the Russian defence ministry. Reuters was not able to independently verify the report. Russia’s defence ministry on Saturday accused Ukraine of attacking Russian energy facilities in the past 24 hours despite a moratorium on striking each other’s energy infrastructure. The ministry said Ukraine attacked power grids in the Belgorod region several times leaving about 9,000 residents without power supply. Reuters could not immediately confirm the account. Both sides this week claimed there were fresh violations as the land war continued unabated. Russian forces are preparing to launch a fresh military offensive in the coming weeks to maximize the pressure on Ukraine and strengthen the Kremlin’s negotiating position in ceasefire talks, according to Ukrainian government and military analysts who spoke to The Associated Press. The Ukrainian officials said the move could give Vladimir Putin every reason to delay discussions about pausing the fighting in favour of seeking more land. Ukrainian leaders have argued repeatedly that Russia has no intention of engaging in meaningful dialogue to end the war. “They’re dragging out the talks and trying to get the US stuck in endless and pointless discussions about fake ‘conditions’ just to buy time and then try to grab more land,” Zelenskyy said on Thursday in a visit to Paris. Two G7 diplomatic officials in Kyiv agreed with that assessment."
world/2025/nov/10/ukraine-war-briefing-lavrov-reappears-ready-to-offer-marco-rubio-same-demands,"Ukraine war briefing: Lavrov reappears, ready to offer Marco Rubio same demands",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/10/ukraine-war-briefing-lavrov-reappears-ready-to-offer-marco-rubio-same-demands,"Ukraine war briefing: Lavrov reappears, ready to offer Marco Rubio same demands","Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, emerged from seclusion to say he was ready to meet the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, to discuss the war in Ukraine and mending bilateral ties. It breaks a weeks-long absence of Lavrov from the public sphere after the collapse of attempts to stage a Putin-Trump summit in Hungary. Speaking to Russia’s Ria state news agency, Lavrov signalled there was no change in Moscow’s maximalist demands for Ukraine’s capitulation. He said peace could not be achieved without “taking Russian interests into account”. Lavrov appeared to be contradicted by the Kremlin after the reappearing foreign minister said work had begun on Vladimir Putin’s order to prepare plans for a possible Russian nuclear test. Putin ordered officials to study the possibility of resuming nuclear testing after Donald Trump’s statements that the US would begin immediately to match nuclear tests by China and Russia – even though, like the US, neither is known to have exploded a nuclear bomb since the 1990s. On Sunday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “Putin has repeatedly said that Russia is committed to its obligation to end nuclear tests, and that we have no intention [of conducting them].” Putin has said Russia would not conduct a nuclear test unless the US did so first. Ukrainian strikes disrupted power and heating to Voronezh and Belgorod – large Russian cities near the Ukrainian border, Russian officials reported on Sunday. In Voronezh, home to just over a million people, a drone started a fire at an energy facility, said the area’s governor. Russian and Ukrainian news channels on Telegram said the Voronezh strike targeted a thermal power plant. A missile strike late on Saturday affected about 20,000 Belgorod households, said the local governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, who declared the “electricity and heating supply network has suffered severe damage”. In the western Kursk region, “a fire broke out at one of the power plants in the village of Korenevo”, cutting power to 10 localities, said the governor, Alexander Khinshtein. Ukrainian crews scrambled on Sunday to repair damage caused by one of the most devastating Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, Volodymyr Zelensky said. “Although the situation is difficult, thousands of people are involved in stabilising the system and repairing the damage,” Ukraine’s president said. The situation was most difficult in the north-eastern regions of Kharkiv and Sumy. Russia has switched tactics, simultaneously striking generation facilities as well as power transmission and distribution systems, said deputy Ukrainian energy minister Artem Nekrasov. “This complicates the prompt restoration of normal power supply and the normal operation of the energy system.” In the central region of Poltava, one of the areas most affected, power was mostly restored on Sunday but damaged equipment left parts of its main city still in the dark, local authorities said. Ukraine’s energy minister, Svitlana Grynchuk, said the wave of attacks, which killed four people, marked “one of the most difficult nights” for Ukrainian energy since the Russian invasion began in February 2022. In an exclusive interview, Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the Guardian’s Luke Harding that “everyone in the world” was afraid of Trump. Asked if that applied to him as well, Ukraine’s president said: “No … we are not enemies with America. We are friends. So why should we be afraid? … Trump was elected by his people. We have to respect the choice made by the American people, just as I am elected by my people.” Zelenskyy credited King Charles with a crucial behind-the-scenes role in encouraging the US president to support Ukraine more enthusiastically. During a state visit to the UK in September, Trump held a one-on-one meeting with the king. “I don’t know all the details but I understand His Majesty sent some important signals to President Trump,” Zelenskyy said. He said Trump respected the king and considered him to be “very important”, a genuine compliment not extended – he thought – to very “many people”. “His Majesty is very sensitive to our people. Maybe sensitive is not the right word. He’s very supportive.” In recent days Russian troops have captured most of the eastern city of Pokrovsk, after a long and bloody campaign. Zelenskyy said Moscow had thrown enormous forces into its operation – “170,000 men” – with the war at its fiercest and most brutal in Donetsk province, Putin’s main objective. “That’s the whole story. There is no [Russian] success there. And many casualties,” he said. According to Zelenskyy, Moscow suffered 25,000 soldiers killed and wounded in October – a record."
world/2025/sep/20/security-guarantees-for-ukraine-require-readiness-to-fight-russia-says-finlands-president,"Security guarantees for Ukraine require readiness to fight Russia, says Finland’s president",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/20/security-guarantees-for-ukraine-require-readiness-to-fight-russia-says-finlands-president,"Security guarantees for Ukraine require readiness to fight Russia, says Finland’s president","Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, has said security guarantees for Ukraine, which are being discussed by the so-called “coalition of the willing”, would compel the European countries that sign to fight Russia if Moscow launched military action against Ukraine again in future. “Security guarantees in essence are a deterrent. That deterrent has to be plausible and in order for it to be plausible it has to be strong,” Stubb told the Guardian, in an interview in Helsinki before travelling to New York for the UN general assembly. He said the guarantees would only come into effect after a future deal between Ukraine and Russia, but insisted that Russia would have no veto over their format. “Russia has absolutely no say in the sovereign decisions of an independent nation state … So for me it’s not an issue will Russia agree or not. Of course they won’t, but that’s not the point,” he said. After the Paris meeting last month, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, told reporters that 26 nations had committed to be part of a “reassurance force” in Ukraine, with some of them committing to be present “on the ground, in the sea or in the air”. However, the big question many in Kyiv have is whether the arrangements would come with concrete commitments. When asked if the guarantees would mean European countries were saying they would be ready to engage militarily with Russia in the case of future aggression against Ukraine, Stubb said: “That is the idea of security guarantees by definition.” It is far from clear that there is political will for this kind of commitment in most European capitals, however, where promises to a postwar Ukraine have usually been framed more as “reassurance” than as firm commitments. Up to now, the policy of most western countries has been to offer support to Ukraine but minimise the risk of a direct conflict with Russia. But Stubb said any guarantees would be meaningless if not backed up with real force. “Security guarantees in essence are a deterrent and that deterrent has to be plausible, and in order for it to be plausible it has to be strong. And that means also strategic communication, so we’re not making security guarantees into the air, but we’re making real security guarantees and Russia knows that,” said Stubb. Stubb has emerged as a key player in peace negotiations in recent months, forging a close relationship with the US president, Donald Trump, including through rounds of golf. The personal connection has meant that Finland, with a population of just 5.6 million, has been able to play an outsized role in communications between Trump and European leaders. Stubb said he and Trump are still in contact regularly, “by phone and other means” and that he expects the pair to have a bilateral meeting this week. Stubb has said on several occasions this year that the US president was beginning to lose patience with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, but so far Trump’s occasional tough words on Putin have not translated into action, and a series of Trump-set deadlines for progress to be made on arriving at a peace deal have passed without much follow-up. Instead, Trump rolled out the red carpet for Putin in Alaska last month. Stubb said he thought progress was being made, but “it’s not a big bazooka, it’s step-by-step”. On the question of whether there is a point when Europe has to accept that the US is not a reliable ally when it comes to Ukraine negotiations, Stubb said his nation had little option but to try as hard as possible to be friendly with the Trump administration. “I think it’s the job of the president of Finland to get along with the president of the United States, whoever he is,” said Stubb. “Foreign policy is always based on three pillars. It’s values, interests and power. Small states only have values and interests … but we can have influence instead of power. Engagement is better than disengagement, come hell or high water,” he added. Last week, Stubb was in Kyiv where he met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and said he came away from the trip “confident” that Ukraine could continue fighting a long war if necessary, dismissing suggestions to the contrary as “fake news”. Stubb said much of the focus at the UN this week will be on Palestine, but that he hopes to have several meetings with Zelenskyy and others related to Ukraine. On security guarantees, he said an “American backstop” would be necessary to give them real force, and conceded that there is not yet a full sense of what the Trump administration is willing to commit. However, the talk of guarantees may all be purely hypothetical if progress is not made first on a negotiated end to the war. Zelenskyy has said many times he is willing to meet Putin, as demanded by Trump, but Putin has said he would only meet Zelenskyy in Moscow, or if numerous Russian demands are met first. Stubb conceded that there did not currently appear much chance of bringing Putin to the table. “This war is too big for him to lose. He has made probably the biggest strategic mistake in recent history, certainly since the end of the cold war, and he has failed in all of his strategic aims. It’s a question when he comes to the negotiating table, hopefully sooner rather than later, but right now I’m quite pessimistic,” said Stubb."
world/2025/feb/28/five-unknowns-about-any-possible-deal-to-end-ukraine-russia-war,Five unknowns about any possible deal to end Ukraine-Russia war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/28/five-unknowns-about-any-possible-deal-to-end-ukraine-russia-war,Five unknowns about any possible deal to end Ukraine-Russia war,"Even before the astonishingly heated exchanges between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington, there were questions over the future of Ukraine and the country’s war with Russia. Here are five things we don’t know about a possible deal to end the conflict. 1) Will Vladimir Putin abide by any peace deal? There is enormous scepticism in Kyiv that Putin wants to stop fighting. His unprovoked full-scale invasion in 2022 triggered the biggest war in Europe since 1945. Russian troops are advancing in the east of the country, though there are signs they are slowing down. Speaking earlier this week, Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate, said Moscow’s long-term strategic ambitions were unchanged. He warned that Putin remains committed to restoring the Russian empire and has designs on former Warsaw pact countries such as the Baltic states and Poland. It is possible the Russian leader will “agree” to a peace deal, in order to regroup and adapt. Ukraine fears that after a tactical pause he will attack again. It wants security guarantees to prevent this scenario. 2) What will happen to Ukraine’s territory? Russia occupies about 20% of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. It controls almost all of Luhansk oblast, much of the Donetsk region, and large chunks of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts. Putin has said Ukraine has to recognise “realities on the ground” – in other words, he won’t give this land back. He is likely to demand full control of all four regions, which Russia “annexed” in 2022. Ukraine rejects this. Formally, Kyiv wants the restoration of the country’s 1991 borders. The president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has hinted he is willing to swap territory inside Russia’s Kursk oblast seized seven months ago by Ukrainian forces. The Kremlin has ruled this out and says it will wipe out the “terrorists” instead. If a Trump peace plan favours Moscow and its maximalist claims, Kyiv will almost certainly reject it. 3) How would a European peacekeeping force work? We don’t know. Key Ukrainian allies including the UK, France and recently Turkey have said they are ready to send troops to Ukraine as part of a peacekeeping or “peace-assuring” force. Zelenskyy has said that at least 100,000 would be needed. He has also said that Nato membership would be the best guarantee of future security in Ukraine, something Trump has ruled out. The plan, such as it is, envisages European troops being deployed away from the 600-mile (1,000km) frontline and in big cities. At the moment, Russia regularly bombards Kyiv and other urban areas with drones and ballistic missiles. Moscow has said it will not allow “Nato” troops to be sent to Ukraine. If they do arrive, it is unclear how Putin will respond. 4) Can the US be persuaded to provide a backstop to guarantee any deal? The British prime minister, Keir Starmer, has said a US backstop is vital if the Europeans are to implement a peace deal. Trump appeared to suggest that the US was willing to provide an economic backstop instead – meaning Americans would be present in Ukraine, as part of a minerals deal, and this would be sufficient to deter the Russians. The meaning of backstop is also unclear. Speaking last week in Kyiv, the Labour MP Alex Sobel said it would mean Nato air cover – to protect western troops and to stop Moscow from violating any ceasefire. There are also questions about US satellite and intelligence data. This has been crucial to Ukraine’s ability to identify and destroy Russian military and logistical targets. Were it to stop, it would hinder Ukraine’s armed forces and a peacekeeping contingent would struggle as well. 5) What will be the impact of the minerals deal? The minerals deal between the US and Ukraine has gone through multiple drafts. Early versions demanded that Kyiv give Washington $500bn (£400bn), with the proceeds paid into a 100% US-controlled fund. This was “payback” for previous US military assistance, Trump said. Commentators described the demand as a mafia shakedown, and reminiscent of Europe’s imperial landgrab in 18th-century Africa. Since then, the $500bn figure has been dropped, with Zelenskyy insisting that previous assistance authorised by Congress was a grant not a debt. The latest draft, which Trump and Zelenskyy are expected to sign on Friday, is vague. It is more like a letter of intent than a detailed and legally binding contract. Some experts believe it might facilitate new investment into Ukraine’s underdeveloped mining and minerals sector. Others are sceptical. Either way, it will be years before profitable titanium, lithium and rare metals can be dug up from new sites, some of which are in Russian-occupied territory."
world/2025/sep/20/ukraine-war-briefing-drones-blast-russias-saratov-refinery-for-second-time-in-a-week,Ukraine war briefing: Drones blast Russia’s Saratov refinery for second time in a week,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/20/ukraine-war-briefing-drones-blast-russias-saratov-refinery-for-second-time-in-a-week,Ukraine war briefing: Drones blast Russia’s Saratov refinery for second time in a week,"One or more large fires erupted early on Saturday at Russia’s Saratov oil refinery as it was hit heavily by Ukrainian drones that attacked the target deep inside Russian territory for at least the second time in a week. Videos vetted and posted by online analysts showed incoming UAVs followed by big explosions and flames rising from the site while air raid sirens blared. The major refinery is nearly 600km (370 miles) east of the frontline in Ukraine. The Russian governor in the area, Roman Busargin, confirmed an attack by UAVs. Russian overnight strikes in the Dnipropetrovsk region killed one person and wounded 13, Ukrainian officials said on Saturday. Ukraine issued a nationwide air alert, with officials reporting other strikes in the region around the capital Kyiv. “The enemy is attacking with strike drones and missiles. Peaceful settlements of the region are under attack,” said Mykola Kalashnyk, the head of the Kyiv regional military administration. The mayor of Mykolaiv said Russia had also hit his southern Ukrainian city with drones and missiles but there were no casualties. Ukrainian troops pressed on with a frontline counteroffensive around two eastern cities on Friday with Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying heavy losses were being inflicted on Russian forces. The counteroffensive had disrupted Russian plans in their longstanding objective of seizing the logistics centre of Pokrovsk, said Ukraine’s president. Russia said its forces captured two new villages – Muravka outside Pokrovsk and Novoivanivka further in the Zaporizhzhia region – but its defence ministry made no reference to the Ukrainian drive near the towns of Pokrovsk and Dobropillia. The general staff of Ukraine’s military listed Muravka among settlements where its forces had halted 87 attacks near Pokrovsk. Zelenskyy also said Ukrainian forces were holding their positions around Kupiansk – an area of Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region that has been subject to Russian assaults for months. It comes after Zelenskyy on Thursday said Ukrainian forces had recaptured seven settlements and 160 sq km (62 sq miles) around Pokrovsk and Dobropillia since the operation began, and that another nine settlements had been “cleared” of enemy forces. The Reuters news agency carried both sides’ claims, saying it could not independently verify them. The outgoing head of MI6 issued a damning indictment of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying that Vladimir Putin has “bitten off more than he can chew”. Ruth Michaelson reports from Istanbul where Richard Moore, known within MI6 as C, gave a farewell speech noting Russian victories on the battlefield remained incremental and incurred massive costs as the Russian president’s army fell far short of its original aims to swiftly capture all of Ukraine. The rising costs now included more than a million casualties – a quarter of them “poorly trained troops from Russia’s poorest regions” that were “fed into the meat grinder”, Moore said. Nato intercepted three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets that violated Estonia’s airspace over the Baltic Sea in a 12-minute incursion, calling it proof of Moscow’s “reckless” behaviour, write Jon Henley and Jakub Krupa. Talinn summoned the Russian envoy to protest. The Estonian defence forces said the MiG-31s were intercepted on Friday morning by Italian F-35 fighter jets based in Ämari in Estonia. The Russian fighters entered Estonian airspace near Vaindloo island in the Gulf of Finland – without flight plans, transponders or notification of air traffic control. Russia denied any incursion. Of the incident, Donald Trump said: “I don’t love it. I don’t like when that happens. Could be big trouble. I’ll let you know later.” EU leaders will discuss their “collective response” to Russia’s violations of European airspace at a meeting in Copenhagen on 1 October, said the European Council president, António Costa. The EU proposed on Friday to bring forward by a year to January 2027 a total ban on Russian natural gas imports as part of its 19th package of sanctions targeting Moscow. The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said “it is time to turn off the tap” of fossil fuel revenue to the Kremlin. The EU has already banned most Russian oil, slashing imports from 29% in early 2021 to 2% by mid-2025. Only Hungary and Slovakia, whose prime ministers are friendly to Moscow and Trump, still buy Russian oil. While pressing Europe to stop importing Russian oil and punish others who do, the US president has taken no action himself – other than waging a tariff war on India ostensibly because of its imports of cheap Russian oil, but also likely connected to a personal grudge against the Indian PM, Narendra Modi. Von der Leyen said that with the latest sanctions, the EU was “going after those who fuel Russia’s war by buying oil in breach of the sanctions”. “We target refineries, oil traders, petrochemical companies in third countries, including China,” she said. Brussels also intends to hit crypto platforms and the credit card system Mir, set up by Russia to avoid reliance on US-based networks, said von der Leyen and the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas. The package also seeks to blacklist 118 more vessels in the “shadow fleet” of ageing tankers used by Russia to circumvent oil export curbs, and 45 firms accused of supporting the Russian military-industrial complex. Entities from Russia, China and India would face export bans and tighter controls, Kallas said. A group of Republican and Democratic US senators introduced legislation on Friday that would expand sanctions against Russian energy, specifically by targeting the “shadow fleet” of oil tankers. The Sanctioning Harbors and Dodgers of Western Sanctions (Shadow) bill has dubious prospects: bipartisan senators have been begging Trump and congressional leaders for months to pass another widely supported bill that would introduce big penalties against Russia and its fossil fuels customers. Different groups of senators also introduced separate bills on Friday seeking to boost security in the east of Europe and use frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine."
world/2025/jun/10/ukraine-war-briefing-russia-launches-drone-attakcs-on-kyiv-and,Ukraine war briefing: Russia launches attacks on Kyiv and Odesa a day after massive drone bombardment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/10/ukraine-war-briefing-russia-launches-drone-attakcs-on-kyiv-and,Ukraine war briefing: Russia launches attacks on Kyiv and Odesa a day after massive drone bombardment,"Kyiv and the port city of Odesa came under “massive” drone attacks from Russia early Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said. One person was killed and at least four wounded in Odesa after residential buildings and medical facilities were hit, the port city’s governor said on Tuesday. “Residential buildings in the centre of Odesa were destroyed and damaged. A 59-year-old man was killed,” said Governor Oleg Kiper, adding that medics were treating four wounded people.An AFP journalist in central Kyiv heard at least a dozen explosions and gunfire, as air defences tried to down the drones. Buildings and cars in several districts were burning and debris fell near a school. The attack came a day after Russia launched almost 500 drones at Ukraine in the biggest overnight drone bombardment of the three-year war, according to the Ukrainian air force, as the Kremlin presses ahead with its summer offensive. In addition to the 479 drones, 20 missiles of various types were fired at different parts of Ukraine from Sunday to Monday, according to the air force, which said the barrage targeted mainly central and western areas. A recent escalation in aerial attacks has coincided with a renewed Russian battlefield push along eastern and northeastern parts of the roughly 1,000-km, (620-mile) frontline. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said late on Sunday that in some of those areas, “the situation is very difficult.” He provided no details. Amid direct peace talks that have yet to deliver progress on stopping the fighting, Russia and Ukraine swapped another batch of prisoners of war Monday. Those who were swapped included wounded soldiers, as well as those under 25, Zelenskyy said. “The process is quite complicated, there are many sensitive details, negotiations continue virtually every day,” he added. The exchange was the result of direct talks between the two sides in Istanbul on 2 June that resulted in an agreement to exchange at least 1,200 PoW on each side and to repatriate thousands of bodies of those killed in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Neither side said how many prisoners had been swapped on Monday. Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia said early on Tuesday it temporarily halted flights at all four major airports serving Moscow to ensure safety, after the defence ministry said Ukraine was carrying out a drone attack on Russia. Russia is determined to test the resolve of the Nato alliance, including by extending its confrontation with the West beyond the borders of Ukraine, Germany’s foreign intelligence chief told the Table Media news organisation. Bruno Kahl, the head of the Federal Intelligence Service, said his agency had clear intelligence indications that Russian officials believed the collective defence obligations enshrined in the Nato treaty no longer had practical force. “We are quite certain, and we have intelligence showing it, that Ukraine is only a step on the journey westward,” Kahl told Table Media in a podcast interview. “That doesn’t mean we expect tank armies to roll westwards,” he added. “But we see that Nato’s collective defence promise is to be tested.” Germany, already the second-largest provider of armaments and financial support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, has pledged to step up its support further under the new government of chancellor Friedrich Merz, promising to help Ukraine develop new missiles that could strike deep into Russian territory."
world/2025/oct/15/putins-cancelled-russia-arab-summit-signals-waning-influence-in-middle-east,Putin’s embarrassing cancellation of Arab summit signals waning influence in Middle East,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/15/putins-cancelled-russia-arab-summit-signals-waning-influence-in-middle-east,Putin’s embarrassing cancellation of Arab summit signals waning influence in Middle East,"When Vladimir Putin first announced he would host a “Russia-Arab world” summit, the Kremlin imagined the region’s leaders flying to Moscow to discuss regional security and energy relations, with the Russian leader presiding. Announced in April and prepared for months, the summit had been scheduled for Wednesday, intended as a showcase of Moscow’s enduring influence in the Middle East and proof it remains far from isolated despite western sanctions. But Putin was forced to shelve the gathering after only a handful of leaders, including Syria’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and the head of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, confirmed their attendance. Instead, on Monday, global attention turned to Egypt, where world leaders gathered for a Gaza “peace summit” – with Russia notably absent. At Sharm el-Sheikh, Donald Trump joined Egypt’s Abdel Fatah al-Sisi in welcoming heads of states from across the Middle East and Europe as they signed a long-awaited Gaza treaty, with leaders jostling to be photographed beside the US president. While analysts say Moscow was never expected to play a major role in the Gaza peace process, its absence in Egypt underscored a reality the Kremlin is reluctant to admit: as the war in Ukraine grinds on, its influence in the Middle East – long touted as a counterweight to that of the west – is waning. “Russia’s diplomatic role in the Middle East has declined as a result of the Ukraine war,” said Hanna Notte, a Berlin-based expert on Russian foreign policy. “When it comes to all the big developments, the major players in the region don’t look towards Moscow any more.” The summit in Egypt also highlighted a shift in the region, where many leaders are now focused on strengthening relations with Trump as Washington’s frustration grows over Putin’s refusal to end the war in Ukraine. For nearly a decade, the Middle East served as the stage for Putin’s long-sought return to global prominence. Russia’s 2015 military intervention in Syria’s civil war saved Bashar al-Assad’s regime from collapse, secured permanent naval and airbases on the Mediterranean, and revived Moscow’s image as a power capable of projecting force far beyond its borders. With its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow was forced to divert much of its military, economic and diplomatic capacity, leaving it unable to prop up Assad as his regime crumbled. It has also watched its other key ally, Iran, see parts of its military and economic infrastructure repeatedly battered by Israeli strikes. Despite years of cultivating ties with the Palestinian Authority and hosting Hamas delegations for talks in Moscow, Russia played no tangible role in the negotiations that produced the Gaza ceasefire. By largely siding with the Palestinians and moving closer to Iran, Putin has strained his once warm relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said last month that Israel had transferred a Patriot missile system to Kyiv. In public Russia’s elites have praised Trump’s efforts to end the war in Gaza, part of a broader charm offensive aimed at currying favour with the US leader. Putin said last Friday that he had offered to postpone his own Russia-Arab world summit “so as not to interfere” with Trump’s initiative, and lauded the US-led push to end the war in Gaza. “If Trump succeeds in accomplishing everything he set out to do, it would be a truly historic event,” he told reporters during a visit to Tajikistan. Still, frustration has seeped through among senior Russian officials at being sidelined. The veteran foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Monday that while Russia “would not refuse to take part in Middle East settlement efforts if invited”, the Kremlin was not going to “impose its services”. There was also open criticism of Trump’s deal. Dmitry Medvedev, the hawkish former president and now deputy chair of Russia’s Security Council, dismissed it as meaningless. “Releasing Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners is a good thing, of course, but it will not solve anything,” he said. “Until a full-fledged Palestinian state is established in line with the well-known UN resolutions, nothing will change. The war will continue. Everyone understands this.” Russia’s retreat from global influence reaches beyond the Middle East. Across Central Asia and the Caucasus, states once seen as loyal satellites – including Kazakhstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan – are steadily drifting out of Moscow’s orbit, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has forced them to reassess the potential risks to their own security. In August, Trump hosted the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House after mediating a peace deal between them. The agreement granted Washington exclusive rights to develop the so-called Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, a corridor cutting through Armenia to link Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave on the Turkish border. Tellingly, both the Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, and Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, travelled to Egypt on Monday. Putin will have another opportunity to host leaders from the Arab world, with the Kremlin indicating that the summit is likely to be rescheduled for November. “A summit serves to reinforces Russia’s message that it is not isolated outside the west,” said Notte. “It matters symbolically for Moscow, but it doesn’t restore Russia’s role as a major player in the region.”"

Germany will provide further military support for Ukraine amounting to about €5bn ($5.65bn), its defence ministry said on Wednesday, as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy met senior officials in Berlin. According to Reuters, in its statement, the ministry pointed to Russian airstrikes, “with many civilians killed and injured, as well as the massive destruction of civilian infrastructure in particular”. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that Germany’s plans to jointly develop long-range missiles with Ukraine, as well as supplies of its tanks to Kyiv, showed that it was already a participant in the Russia-Ukraine war. German chancellor Friedrich Merz, speaking during a visit of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Berlin on Wednesday, said his government would not impose any range limits on the missiles which could be produced in Ukraine and Germany. Russia has proposed holding the next round of peace talks with Ukraine on 2 June in Istanbul, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday. “The Russian side, as agreed, has promptly developed a relevant memorandum, which sets out our position on all aspects of reliably overcoming the root causes of the crisis,” he said. Nearly 175,000 servicemen have signed Russian army contracts since the beginning of the year, the TASS state news agency reported on Wednesday, quoting top security official Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev, Russia’s former president, also said that more than 14,000 additional people had joined the army on a volunteer basis, TASS reported. German prosecutors have charged three people – a Ukrainian, a Russian and an Armenian – with foreign agent activity, on suspicion of spying on a Ukrainian man in Germany with the possible aim of killing him, prosecutors said on Wednesday. The target of the operation was a man who had taken part in combat operations for the Ukrainian armed forces following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a statement from the federal prosecutor said. Ukraine’s military said on Wednesday it struck several Russian weapon production sites during a major overnight drone attack that Moscow said its air defences had repelled. The latest attack struck Russia’s Kronstadt plant, which produces drones in the town of Dubna outside Moscow, and the nearby Raduga plant that makes cruise missiles, Ukraine’s general staff said. Russia’s military has committed “crimes against humanity” and “war crimes” in its drone attacks on civilians in Ukraine’s Kherson region, UN experts concluded in a report published on Wednesday. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, established by the UN human rights council, said Russian armed forces were “systematically” hitting civilians, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Zelenskyy said that Ukraine not being invited to the upcoming Nato summit would mean a victory for Russian president Vladimir Putin over the alliance. Zelenskyy had said on Tuesday that Nato chief Mark Rutte wanted Ukraine to attend the summit. Ukraine has protested to the international atomic energy watchdog about reports that Russia is building power lines to connect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to its own grid, a Ukrainian official said on Wednesday. Belarus will scale back military drills with Russia planned for September, cutting the number of soldiers taking part and moving them away from the western border, Minsk said on Wednesday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). The Kremlin believes that US president Donald Trump was not fully informed about the Russia-Ukraine conflict, foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said on Wednesday, according to Reuters. Russia has massed more than 50,000 troops, including some of its best forces, near Ukraine’s north-eastern Sumy region, but Kyiv has taken steps to prevent them from conducting a large-scale offensive, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, according to Reuters. Turkey’s foreign minister will travel to Kyiv on Thursday for a two-day visit after discussing peace efforts to end Russia’s war in Ukraine in Moscow earlier this week, a Turkish foreign ministry source told Reuters on Wednesday. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said Russian president Vladimir Putin may be intentionally delaying negotiations on a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine and expressed disappointment at Russian bombing. “We’re going to find out whether or not he’s tapping us along or not, and if he is, we’ll respond a little differently,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. Russia has proposed holding the next round of peace talks with Ukraine on 2 June in Istanbul, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday. “The Russian side, as agreed, has promptly developed a relevant memorandum, which sets out our position on all aspects of reliably overcoming the root causes of the crisis,” he said. The Russian delegation, led by Vladimir Medinskiy, is ready to present the memorandum to the Ukrainian side and to provide necessary clarifications during the second round of resumed direct talks in Istanbul next Monday, Lavrov added. Vladimir Medinsky, the head of Russia’s delegation at peace talks on Ukraine, said on Wednesday he had sent proposals to Ukraine with a date and venue to exchange memorandums, or conditions, to stop the fighting. He also said on the Telegram messaging app that he expected a reply and that Russia’s delegation was ready to meet its Ukrainian counterpart face-to-face in the coming days. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that Germany’s plans to jointly develop long-range missiles with Ukraine, as well as supplies of its tanks to Kyiv, showed that it was already a participant in the Russia-Ukraine war. German chancellor Friedrich Merz, speaking during a visit of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Berlin on Wednesday, said his government would not impose any range limits on the missiles which could be produced in Ukraine and Germany. Lavrov told a Russian state TV reporter that Berlin’s decisions were “building tension”, adding that he hoped “responsible politicians” in Germany “will make the right conclusion and stop the madness.” Nearly 175,000 servicemen have signed Russian army contracts since the beginning of the year, the TASS state news agency reported on Wednesday, quoting top security official Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev, Russia’s former president, also said that more than 14,000 additional people had joined the army on a volunteer basis, TASS reported. German prosecutors have charged three people – a Ukrainian, a Russian and an Armenian – with foreign agent activity, on suspicion of spying on a Ukrainian man in Germany with the possible aim of killing him, prosecutors said on Wednesday. The target of the operation was a man who had taken part in combat operations for the Ukrainian armed forces following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a statement from the federal prosecutor said. The Armenian man, identified only as Vardges I, was tasked with spying by the Russian intelligence service, the statement added. He is said to have recruited Ukrainian national Robert A. and Russian national Arman S. to assist with the operation, Reuters reported. The plot involved a planned meeting with the target at a cafe in central Frankfurt in June 2024, but he did not show up after being tipped off by German authorities, the prosecutor said. “The spying operation presumably served to prepare further intelligence operations in Germany, possibly including the killing of the target person,” the statement said. The three suspects have been in custody since their arrest on 19 June 2024, the day of the attempted meeting. European security officials have warned of the increased threat of hybrid attacks by Russia in the wake of the Ukraine war, including espionage and sabotage targeting critical infrastructure. Ukraine’s military said on Wednesday it struck several Russian weapon production sites during a major overnight drone attack that Moscow said its air defences had repelled. The latest attack struck Russia’s Kronstadt plant, which produces drones in the town of Dubna outside Moscow, and the nearby Raduga plant that makes cruise missiles, Ukraine’s general staff said. The Angstrem microchip factory in Moscow region was also struck, it said, adding that the facility produced components widely used by Russia’s military-industrial complex. The factory is in the Elma Technological Park in Zelenograd. Videos circulating online showed fire and smoke at the technological park. Reuters was able to independently confirm the location of the video, but not the date of the footage. Russia’s defence ministry said its air defences had downed 296 Ukrainian drones over 13 regions overnight. The Ukrainian military’s statement did not make clear what weapons its forces used to conduct the long-range attack. But an official from Ukraine’s SBU security agency said in a written statement that the Ukrainian side had used drones. Kyiv lacks an arsenal of long-range missiles. Ukraine’s general staff also said it conducted a “successful” attack on a factory in Ivanovo region the day before. The factory makes organic chemicals, components of explosives and powders, as well as additives for rocket and aviation fuel, it said. Reuters could not independently confirm the claims by either side. Germany will provide further military support for Ukraine amounting to about €5bn ($5.65bn), its defence ministry said on Wednesday, as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy met senior officials in Berlin. According to Reuters, in its statement, the ministry pointed to Russian airstrikes, “with many civilians killed and injured, as well as the massive destruction of civilian infrastructure in particular”. The aid will be financed by funds already approved by Germany’s lower house of parliament, it added. Russia’s military has committed “crimes against humanity” and “war crimes” in its drone attacks on civilians in Ukraine’s Kherson region, UN experts concluded in a report published on Wednesday. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, established by the UN human rights council, said Russian armed forces were “systematically” hitting civilians, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “Russian armed forces have committed the crimes against humanity of murder and the war crimes of attacking civilians, through a months-long pattern of drone attacks targeting civilians on the right bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Province,” the inquiry said. These acts were committed with the primary purpose to spread terror among the civilian population, in violation of international humanitarian law. They added: The attacks are continuing at the time of the publication of this report. The inquiry said that since July last year, Russian military drone operators on the left bank of the Dnipro had “systematically” struck civilians, and had “targeted ambulances”. The commission documented drone attacks on civilians in Kherson city and 16 other localities, geolocating videos of attacks and reviewing open sources. Nearly 150 civilians had been killed and hundreds injured, the report said, citing official sources. It said men, women and children were among the victims. Several Russian Telegram channels with links to the perpetrating military units, some of them with thousands of followers, have disseminated hundreds of videos of the attacks from the original feeds of the drones. The footage “leaves no doubt that they intended to target civilians”. The report said the attacks amount to the war crimes of intentionally directing attacks against civilians. The recurrence of such attacks for more than 10 months, against multiple civilian targets in a wide area “demonstrates that they are widespread and systematic and have been planned”. Such elements “led the commission to conclude that Russian armed forces carried out drone attacks targeting civilians pursuant to an organisational policy and committed murder as a crime against humanity”, the investigation said. The commission concluded that publishing of videos of civilians being killed and injured “amounts to the war crime of outrages upon personal dignity”. Germany will “do everything” to make sure the damaged Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia will not resume deliveries of natural gas to Europe, chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Wednesday. “We will continue to increase the pressure on Russia,” Merz said at a press conference with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin. He added: We will do everything in this context to ensure that Nord Stream 2 cannot be put back into operation. The Nord Stream 2 gas link connecting Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea was damaged in September 2022 by huge underwater explosions, said to be an act of sabotage. The explosions destroyed one of the two pipes of Nord Stream 2 and both branches of its controversial sister pipeline, Nord Stream 1. While Nord Stream 2 never went into operation, Nord Stream 1 for years shipped cheap Russian gas to Europe via Germany. Critics have argued the existence of the pipeline left Germany and the rest of Europe over reliant on fossil fuel deliveries from Moscow. German and British media have recently reported that Washington and Moscow had discussed the idea of reviving the Nord Stream 2 project during talks on ending the war in Ukraine, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Senior political figures in Merz’s own party had also expressed tentative support for restarting gas deliveries via the pipeline from Russia before the chancellor definitively ruled out the possibility. European Commission president chief Ursula von der Leyen said earlier this month the bloc was working on a new set of sanctions that would include measures against Nord Stream 1 and 2, pre-empting a restart. Explaining the measures, EU spokesperson Paula Pinho said, “the idea is to dissuade any interest, and notably interest from investors, in pursuing any activity on Nord Stream, also in the future”. Istanbul could be a venue for the next round of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday. German chancellor Friedrich Merz said Wednesday during a visit by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Berlin will help Kyiv develop new long-range weapons that can hit targets in Russian territory, AFP reported. “Our defence ministers will sign a memorandum of understanding today regarding the procurement of Ukrainian-made long-range weapons systems,” said Merz, without naming the manufacturers involved. “There will be no range restrictions, allowing Ukraine to fully defend itself, even against military targets outside its own territory,” he told a joint press conference. The production of long-range weapons “can take place both in Ukraine and here in Germany,” he said. “We will not provide any further details until further notice.” Merz hailed the project as “the beginning of a new form of military-industrial cooperation between our countries that has great potential”. Zelenskyy also said on Wednesday that Ukraine’s defence minister, who was the leader of Ukraine’s Istanbul negotiating team, had a call with the head of Russia’s team to those talks. He is speaking at a joint news conference in Berlin with German chancellor Merz. Zelenskyy said that Ukraine not being invited to the upcoming Nato summit would mean a victory for Russian president Vladimir Putin over the alliance. Zelenskyy had said on Tuesday that Nato chief Mark Rutte wanted Ukraine to attend the summit. However, it was still not clear whether Kyiv would be invited. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that Ukraine and Germany had reached new agreements on defence sector investments. Zelenskyy, who was speaking in Berlin alongside German chancellor Friedrich Merz, did not give further details. Kyiv has increasingly sought money from its allies to fund its own burgeoning defence industry. Ukrainian president Volydymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine and Germany have new agreements on defence sector investments. More details soon … “We Europeans are ready to support technical talks between Ukraine and Russia,” German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has said at a joint press conference in Berlin with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. More details to follow … Ukraine has protested to the international atomic energy watchdog about reports that Russia is building power lines to connect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to its own grid, a Ukrainian official said on Wednesday. Yuriy Vitrenko, Ukraine’s representative to international bodies in Vienna, told Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform that Kyiv sees any attempt by Russia to connect the occupied plant to its grid as a gross violation of international law and Ukrainian sovereignty.

Here are some images coming in via the newswires of Ukrainian president Volodymr Zelenskyy in Berlin today: Belarus will scale back military drills with Russia planned for September, cutting the number of soldiers taking part and moving them away from the western border, Minsk said on Wednesday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Belarus is a key Russian ally and allowed its territory to be used as a staging post for Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Kyiv, as well as Poland and the Baltic states, have repeatedly expressed alarm about possible military buildups in the country. “We have decided to reduce the parameters of the ‘Zapad-2025’ exercise and to move its main manoeuvres deep into the territory of the Republic of Belarus, away from the western borders,” defence minister Viktor Khrenin said in a statement posted on Wednesday on the ministry’s Telegram channel. “The number of troops participating in the drills will be cut almost by half,” Gen Valery Revenko, the head of the ministry’s department for international cooperation said at a security forum in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek. Russian state media reported about 13,000 soldiers were originally to take part in the drills. Khrenin said the move was “to demonstrate to our allies and partners around the world the truly peace-loving position of the Republic of Belarus”. The Zapad military drills usually involve tens of thousands of troops in a show of force close to Belarus’s western border with EU and Nato members. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy last month warned Russia was “preparing something” in Belarus “using military drills as cover”. “That’s usually how they start a new attack,” he said. About 200,000 troops participated in the 2021 edition of Zapad, staged just months before Moscow invaded Ukraine. The Kremlin believes that US president Donald Trump was not fully informed about the Russia-Ukraine conflict, foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said on Wednesday, according to Reuters. He was commenting on remarks by Trump that Vladimir Putin was “playing with fire” by refusing to engage in ceasefire talks with Kyiv. Pope Leo XIV appealed on Wednesday for an end to the war in Ukraine, reports Reuters. During his weekly general audience in St Peter’s Square, the pontiff decried new attacks against civilians and infrastructure in Ukraine in the days since Russia launched the biggest aerial attack of the three-year war. “I renew with vigour my appeal to stop the war and to support every initiative of dialogue and peace,” said the pope. The pope’s appeal, made in Italian, came at the end of his audience, when he added some brief comments to his prepared text, reports Reuters. Russia has massed more than 50,000 troops, including some of its best forces, near Ukraine’s north-eastern Sumy region, but Kyiv has taken steps to prevent them from conducting a large-scale offensive, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, according to Reuters. The buildup comes as Russia appears to be gearing up for a summer offensive in Ukraine while Kyiv waits for Moscow to present a memorandum laying out its conditions to proceed with ceasefire talks. Sumy lies across the border from Russia’s Kursk region where Ukraine previously seized and held a pocket of land for months, before being almost fully pushed out last month, although it says it still holds some small areas there. “Their largest, strongest forces are currently on the Kursk front,” Zelenskyy told reporters on Tuesday. “To push our troops out of the Kursk region and to prepare offensive actions against the Sumy region.” Vladimir Putin has said he wants a “buffer zone” along Russia’s border with Ukraine. Zelenskyy said he believed Russia wants to carve out an area of Ukrainian territory about 10km (6 miles) deep. Russia has captured at least four border villages in the region recently, and has been creeping slowly forwards over the past several weeks on parts of the frontline in eastern Ukraine near the city of Kostiantynivka. However, the Ukrainian leader said that the Russians had been pushed back in that area by 4km (2.5 miles) over two days, reports Reuters. Zelenskyy told reporters in a briefing that his government was ready for further peace talks in any format. He said he expected the next round to be at a technical level, but said he would be ready for a three-way meeting with US president Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin. He said he did not want the United States to leave the Ukraine peace process, as Washington has threatened to do if progress is not made. Turkey’s foreign minister will travel to Kyiv on Thursday for a two-day visit after discussing peace efforts to end Russia’s war in Ukraine in Moscow earlier this week, a Turkish foreign ministry source told Reuters on Wednesday. Foreign minister Hakan Fidan held talks in Moscow on Monday and Tuesday, meeting Russian president Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials, including Moscow’s top negotiator at talks in Istanbul earlier this month aimed at ending the three-year war. In Kyiv, Fidan is expected to meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, prime minister Denys Shmyhal, his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha, and defence minister Rustem Umerov, who is also Kyiv’s top negotiator with Russia, the source said. During the talks, Fidan will repeat an offer to host further peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, the source added. He will “point to the increasingly heavier negative effects of the Russia-Ukraine war, emphasising the need for the war to end through diplomacy, and for a fair and lasting peace to be achieved,” the source told Reuters. Fidan will also discuss bilateral ties, in relation to trade, energy, defence and security, while conveying Turkey’s readiness to take part in Ukraine’s postwar reconstruction. Russia is under increasing pressure to agree a ceasefire, and Ankara has repeatedly said the sides need to continue talks after the first direct contact between the sides since March 2022 – also in Istanbul – took place earlier this month. Delegates from Moscow and Kyiv did not agree on a ceasefire in Istanbul this month, but agreed to trade 1,000 prisoners of war and deliver, in writing, their conditions for a possible ceasefire. Russian sources have said that Nato member Turkey, which has maintained good ties with both sides since the start of the war, could be a venue for future talks. A meeting between Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US president Donald Trump would be possible only after Kyiv and Moscow reach “concrete agreements”, the Kremlin said on Wednesday in response to Zelenskyy’s call for a three-way summit (see 8.43am BST). “Such a meeting should be the result of concrete agreements between the [Ukrainian and Russian] delegations,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Russian troops took control of the settlement of Kostyantynivka in Ukraine’s Sumy region and Zelene Pole in the Donetsk region, the Russian defence ministry said on Wednesday. Reuters could not independently confirm the battlefield report. After a joint press conference with chancellor Friedrich Merz and talks with German business leaders, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to meet German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier at Bellevue Palace. President Vladimir Putin’s conditions for ending the war in Ukraine include a demand that western leaders pledge in writing to stop enlarging Nato eastwards and lift a chunk of sanctions on Russia, reports Reuters citing three Russian sources with knowledge of the negotiations. “Putin is ready to make peace but not at any price,” said one senior Russian source with knowledge of top-level Kremlin thinking, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The three Russian sources told Reuters that Putin wants a “written” pledge by major western powers not to enlarge the US-led Nato alliance eastwards – shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova and other former Soviet republics. Kyiv has repeatedly said that Russia should not be granted veto power over its aspirations to join the Nato alliance. Ukraine says it needs the west to give it a strong security guarantee with teeth to deter any future Russian attack. Nato has also in the past said that it will not change its “open door” policy just because Moscow demands it. A spokesperson for the 32-member alliance did not respond to Reuters’ questions. Russia also wants Ukraine to be neutral, some western sanctions lifted, a resolution of the issue of frozen Russian sovereign assets in the west, and protection for Russian speakers in Ukraine, the three sources said. The first source told Reuters that, if Putin realises he is unable to reach a peace deal on his own terms, he will seek to show the Ukrainians and the Europeans by military victories that “peace tomorrow will be even more painful”. The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment on Reuters’ reporting. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s administration also did not respond to a request by Reuters for comment. Reuters reported in January that Putin was growing concerned by the economic distortions in Russia’s wartime economy, amid labour shortages and high interest rates imposed to curb inflation. The first source told Reuters that if Putin saw a tactical opportunity on the battlefield, he would push further into Ukraine – and that the Kremlin believed Russia could fight on for years no matter what sanctions and economic pain were imposed by the west. A second source said that Putin was now less inclined to compromise on territory and was sticking to his public stance that he wanted the entirety of four regions in eastern Ukraine claimed by Russia. “Putin has toughened his position,” the second source told Reuters of the question of territory. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Berlin for talks with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, a Ukraine delegation member told Agence France-Presse (AFP). Russian air defences destroyed or intercepted more than 100 Ukrainian drones over various Russian regions, including a swarm of drones heading for Moscow, officials said early on Wednesday, according to Reuters. Russia in the past week also sent waves of drones to attack Ukrainian cities, including what Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy described as the launch of more than 900 drones over a three-day period ending early on Monday morning. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin, writing in a series of posts on the Telegram messaging app, said defence ministry units had repelled 27 drones while they were travelling towards the Russian capital. Reuters reports that Sobyanin made no mention of casualties or damage, saying only that recovery teams were examining drone fragments at the sites where they hit the ground. Russia’s defence ministry had earlier said its units had downed 112 drones between 9pm and midnight Moscow time. Fifty-nine of those drones were intercepted over the Bryansk region on the Ukrainian border, with other incidents occurring in five different regions, it said. The governor of Bryansk region reported no casualties, but said a house and six cars had been damaged in the attack. In Smolensk region, near the Polish border, the regional governor said 11 drones had been downed, with no casualties, reports Reuters. The three-night Russian drone barrage against Ukraine struck a series of cities and represented one of the biggest such assaults since Moscow launched the full-scale war in early 2022. The strikes on Saturday night killed at least 12 people, Ukrainian officials said, including three children in the region of Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv. Hours after Zelenskyy spoke, Ukraine unleashed one of its largest ever drone barrages on Russia, firing almost 300 drones at the country, according to the defence ministry in Moscow. Russian officials reported only minimal damage from the attacks. On the battlefield, Zelenskyy said that Russia was “amassing” more than 50,000 troops on the frontline around the north-eastern Sumy border region, where Moscow’s army has captured a number of settlements as it seeks to establish what Putin has called a “buffer zone” inside Ukrainian territory. Russia will announce the next round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine soon Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday. The neutral status of Ukraine remains one of Russia’s key demands in the peace negotiations, Lavrov added, according to Reuters. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for a three-way summit with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Russian president Putin rejected calls to meet Zelenskyy in Turkey earlier this month and the Kremlin has said a meeting between the two leaders would only happen after some kind of “agreement” is reached. The US president, meanwhile, has expressed frustration at both Putin and Zelenskyy for not yet striking a deal to end the war. “If Putin is not comfortable with a bilateral meeting, or if everyone wants it to be a trilateral meeting, I don’t mind. I am ready for any format,” Zelenskyy said in comments to journalists on Tuesday that were published on Wednesday, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). The Ukrainian leader said he was “ready” for a “Trump-Putin-me” meeting, and also urged Washington to hit Moscow with a package of hard-hitting sanctions on its banking and energy sector. “We are waiting for sanctions from the United States of America,” Zelenskyy said, adding: Trump confirmed that if Russia does not stop, sanctions will be imposed. We discussed two main aspects with him – energy and the banking system. Will the US be able to impose sanctions on these two sectors? I would very much like that. The Ukrainian leader had previously appeared to express frustration at Washington for not having announced fresh sanctions on Moscow after Russia rejected a coordinated western appeal for an immediate ceasefire. Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine is yet to receive a promised “memorandum” from Russia on its demands for a peace deal. Today Volodymyr Zelenskyy will travel to Berlin to meet Friedrich Merz with speculation that the German chancellor could give the go-ahead to send long-awaited Taurus missiles to Ukraine. However, Merz is facing criticism over such a move from his centre-left coalition partners, the Social Democrats. You can read our report here: It also comes amid an escalating US-Russian war of words amid no progress towards any meaningful ceasefire. Last night, top Russian security official Dmitry Medvedev, responding to Donald Trump’s warning that Vladimir Putin is “playing with fire”, said that the only truly bad thing to worry about was “WWIII”. Medvedev wrote on X: Regarding Trump’s words about Putin “playing with fire” and “really bad things” happening to Russia. I only know of one REALLY BAD thing – WWIII. I hope Trump understands this! On Wednesday, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine is yet to receive a promised “memorandum” from Russia on its demands for a peace deal. In comments to reporters released on Wednesday, Zelenskyy said Russia had pledged to “convey what they see as the next steps and whether Russia is capable of supporting a ceasefire”, adding that Ukraine would “read their proposals and definitely respond” once it receives them. More on this story in a moment, but first, here are some other key updates: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for a three-way summit with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. “If Putin is not comfortable with a bilateral meeting, or if everyone wants it to be a trilateral meeting, I don’t mind. I am ready for any format,” Zelenskyy said in comments published on Wednesday. Russian defence minister Andrei Belousov said on Wednesday that the US-led Nato military alliance was using the Ukrainian crisis to build up its presence across eastern Europe and the Baltic, Russian news agencies reported. Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, called Medvedev’s third world war comment “reckless” and called on Russia to “cease fire immediately” and provide a promised but undelivered peace process memorandum. Zelenskyy said Russia is amassing “more than 50,000” troops on the frontline around the north-eastern Sumy border region, where Moscow’s army has captured a number of settlements as it seeks to establish a “buffer zone” inside Ukrainian territory. “Now they are also amassing troops in the Sumy direction. More than 50,000,” Zelensky told reporters on Tuesday, in remarks published on Wednesday. A major Ukrainian drone attack late over Tuesday night into Wednesday led to at least two Moscow airports, Vnukovo and Zhukovsky, suspending flights, Russian authorities said. The defence ministry said 112 Ukrainian drones targeted six different regions in the three hours up to midnight. Russian drones hit the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, injuring eight people including a child, the regional military governor said on Wednesday morning. Ukraine’s air force issued an air raid alert due to drones across regions including Kharkiv, Sumy, Odesa, Kyiv and others."

Russian attacks on Ukraine killed at least five people on Saturday and cut power to parts of Ukraine’s southern Odesa region, according to Ukrainian officials. Two people died inside a church in Kostyantynivka when it was hit, according to local authorities. In Russia’s border region of Belgorod, a truck driver was killed by a Ukrainian strike, according to local officials. Work continued on Saturday to restore power in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, after Russian attacks. Power had been restored to more than 800,000 residents by Saturday and the largest private energy company, DTEK, said the main work to restore power was complete though some outages remained. Ukraine’s air defences intercepted or jammed 54 of 78 Russian drones launched against Ukraine overnight, the air force said on Saturday. Russia’s defence ministry said it shot down 42 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory. Cuba on Saturday denied US claims it has sent soldiers to fight in the Ukraine war, while stating Cuban authorities “do not have precise information about Cuban nationals” participating “on their own” or “in the military forces of both sides”. The ministry in Havana said 26 Cubans had been sentenced to prison terms ranging from five to 14 years for mercenary activity since September 2023 when reports circulated of Cubans being sent to the front in Ukraine. I Want to Live, a Ukrainian government initiative that encourages enemy combatants to surrender, said in May: “We reliably know the names and personal details of 1,028 Cubans who signed contracts with the Russian armed forces in 2023-2024.” The Cuban foreign ministry said of Cubans who might be involved: “It is irrefutable that none of them have the encouragement, commitment, or consent of the Cuban state for their actions.” Relatives of Cubans who left for Russia in 2023 told Agence France-Presse at the time that their loved ones had been deceptively recruited through advertisements on social media."
world/2025/apr/25/how-north-korea-arms-russia-in-ukraine-war,From ammunition to ballistic missiles: how North Korea arms Russia in the Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/25/how-north-korea-arms-russia-in-ukraine-war,From ammunition to ballistic missiles: how North Korea arms Russia in the Ukraine war,"North Korea’s role in the war in Ukraine has come into sharp focus after the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said a Russian missile that killed 12 people in Kyiv had been supplied by the regime in Pyongyang. “According to preliminary information, the Russians used a ballistic missile manufactured in North Korea,” Zelenskyy said. “Our special services are verifying all the details. “If the information that this missile was made in North Korea is confirmed, this will be further proof of the criminal nature of the alliance between Russia and Pyongyang.” The North Korean KN-23 (KN-23A) ballistic missile reportedly struck a residential block in the Sviatoshynskyi district of the Ukrainian capital early on Thursday. Zelenskyy’s claims are a reminder of the Kremlin’s increasing reliance on the North’s soldiers and ammunition and, critically, its missiles. Moscow and Pyongyang have denied reports that thousands of North Korean troops were sent to fight in Russia’s western Kursk region last autumn. Both insist there have been no weapons transfers that would violate UN sanctions. But experts have been able to form a clearer picture of the North’s material role in the conflict based on satellite imagery, verified social media videos, intercepted military reports and information released by intelligence services in Ukraine and South Korea. In addition to large quantities of artillery shells, North Korea has supplied Russia with multiple-launch rocket systems and long-range artillery, as well as ballistic missiles that were first used against Ukrainian positions at the end of 2023. The North had supplied Russia with 148 KN-23 and KN-24 ballistic missiles by the start of this year, according to reports attributed to Ukraine’s military spy agency. The missiles are of the type believed to have been used in this week’s deadly attack on Kyiv, which also injured at least 90 people. KN-23 missiles are armed with warheads of up to one tonne, making them more powerful than the Russian equivalent missiles, a Ukrainian source told Reuters. The North Korean inventory is not confined to missiles. A joint investigation by Reuters and the Open Source Centre, an independent UK-based research organisation, found that millions of its shells had found their way to the frontline by sea and then train. The investigation tracked 64 shipments, made by a special fleet of Russian munitions carriers, over 20 months. It comprised nearly 16,000 containers and millions of artillery rounds for use against Ukraine. One shipment was made as recently as 17 March, the report said. The OSC said its study of hundreds of satellite images and three-dimensional reconstructions of the vessels, containers and munitions “reveals a sobering truth: since September 2023, North Korea has shipped over 15,000 containers likely containing over 4 million artillery shells and rockets, potentially worth several billions of dollars”. North Korean munitions and weapons have had a significant impact on the Kremlin’s ability to prosecute the war, which began in February 2022. The investigation quoted an expert in the Ukrainian military who said the North’s contribution accounted for as much as 70% of munitions used by Russian artillery units. “North Korea’s contribution has been strategically vital,” said Hugh Griffiths, who from 2014 to 2019 was the coordinator of a UN panel of experts that monitored sanctions against North Korea. “Without Chairman Kim Jong-un’s support, President Vladimir Putin wouldn’t really be able to prosecute his war in Ukraine.” Other experts said the North had furnished Russia with a combination of outdated or surplus ammunition, as well as newer weapons that have now been field-tested in the war against Ukraine. In a recent report, 38 North, part of the Stimson Center thinktank in Washington, listed artillery and mortar shells, multiple rocket launchers and rockets, as well as self-propelled guns among the old weapons and ammunition Pyongyang had sent to Russian forces. Tianran Xu, an expert on military technology at the Open Nuclear Network, speculated that the North had been eager to offload the hardware, which some experts say has poor levels of accuracy. Of greater significance, Xu said, was the provision of new weaponry that enhances Russia’s attack capabilities and gives the North Korean regime the ability to gauge the weapons’ performance on the battlefield. They include more than 140 Hwasong-11 series short-range ballistic missiles, parts from which were discovered after a Russian strike on Ukrainian forces in January in 2024. The 38 North report speculated that the longer the war continued, the greater the likelihood that North Korea would send more sophisticated weapons to the battlefield, including anti-tank guided missiles, surface-to-air missiles, medium-range ballistic missiles and drones jointly developed with Russia. “If the war drags on, North Korean weapon provision to Russia is most likely to escalate further,” Xu wrote on the 38 North website. “The combat performance of these hardware in Ukraine will give Pyongyang a valuable opportunity to evaluate and refine its domestic weapon systems. “In return for Pyongyang’s lethal aid, Moscow will likely reciprocate with weapons and/or military technologies, further strengthening North Korea’s offensive and defensive capabilities on the Korean peninsula and beyond.” The first North Korean deployment of about 11,000 soldiers came after their ruler, Kim Jong-un, and Vladimir Putin agreed to a “strategic partnership treaty” during a summit in Pyongyang in June 2024. The troops were deployed to fight against the Ukrainian counter-invasion of the Russian border region of Kursk, according to South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff. About 4,000 of them have reportedly been killed or injured, and some have been taken prisoner. The mass casualties apparently prompted their withdrawal from the frontlines in January, Ukrainian officials said; however Pyongyang appears to have sent at least 3,000 additional soldiers early this year, the South’s military said last month."

The Ukrainian-made FP-5 missile can fly 3,000km (1,864 miles) and land within 14 metres (45ft) of its target, and is one of the largest such missiles in the world, able to deliver a warhead of 1,150kg (2,535lb), according to experts. It is commonly known as a Flamingo missile because initial versions came out pink after the factory used the wrong paint, and is a partial alternative to the advanced Tomahawk missiles that the US has held back from supplying to Ukraine. The general staff said Ukrainian forces hit a marine oil terminal in occupied Crimea, a helicopter parking lot and UAV storage area, training areas at the Kirovsk airfield, and an air defence radar station in the Yevpatoria area. “In the temporarily occupied territory of Zaporizhzhia region, an oil depot in the Berdiansk area and forward command posts of the 5th Combined Arms Army and the 127th Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian occupiers were hit. Facilities on the territory of the Russian Federation were also hit. The extent of the damage is being clarified … The Ukrainian Defence Forces continue systematic fire damage to facilities involved in providing support to the Russian occupation army.” Russian forces launched a “massive” drone and missile attack on Kyiv early on Friday, officials said, striking apartment buildings and triggering explosions and fires. “Air defences are in action in Kyiv,” said the mayor, Vitali Klitschko. Klitschko said falling debris had struck a five-storey apartment building in Dniprovskyi district on the east side of the Dnipro River and a high-rise dwelling was on fire in Podil district on the opposite bank. Tymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv’s military administration, said both drones and missiles had been deployed against the capital. Ukraine’s air force reported that Russian missiles were targeting Kyiv and several other regions. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine’s top commander, visited units fighting to hold Pokrovsk in the eastern Donetsk region and coordinate operations in person, he said on Thursday. Syrskyi said key goals were to regain control of certain areas, protect supply and evacuation lines and create new ones. “There is no question of Russian control over the city of Pokrovsk or of the operational encirclement of Ukraine’s defence forces in the area,” Syrskyi said. According to the Financial Times (paywalled), the involvement of Russia’s Rubicon unit, which uses drones to hunt Ukrainian drone operators, has enabled Russian advances in the battle for Pokrovsk. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, said he was not opposed to withdrawing amid the “very difficult” situation in Pokrovsk but it was a decision for commanders on the ground. “No one is forcing them to die for the sake of ruins. I will support our soldiers, especially the commanders who are there, in how they can control the situation, or it’s too expensive for us. The most important thing for us is our soldiers,” the president said in an interview with Bloomberg (paywalled). The Institute for the Study of War said: “Russian forces will likely collapse the pocket around Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, but the significance of seizing these towns will depend on the circumstances and conduct of the Ukrainian withdrawal.” Zelenskyy visited troops near the south-eastern front on Thursday and said the situation near the village of Orikhiv was “one of the most difficult”. Thwarting Russian forces there was key to shielding the city of Zaporizhzhia. “An important city, the enemy certainly wants it,” the president said of the regional capital. “We certainly have to defend it,” he said, awarding medals to troops and discussing ways to strengthen the lines. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was releasing a €6bn loan to Ukraine and promised more money for Kyiv. “We will cover the financial needs of Ukraine for the next two years.” The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, “thinks he can outlast us” in the battle over Ukraine’s future, she said in a speech to the European parliament on Thursday. “And this is a clear miscalculation,” she said. “Now is therefore the moment to come, with a new impetus, to unlock Putin’s cynical attempt to buy time and bring him to the negotiation table.”"
